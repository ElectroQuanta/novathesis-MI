Addressing UAVs' conflicting demands for security, safety, and \gls{swap-c} efficiency necessitates rethinking conventional mixed-criticality architectures. This chapter presents the design of the \gls{sspfs}: a trustworthy flight stack leveraging the Bao hypervisor for video surveillance applications, where resource-intensive but non-critical streaming coexists with safety-critical flight control on consolidated hardware.

The conventional \gls{umpfs} approach employs separate hardware nodesâ€”a flight controller for critical systems and a companion computer for tasks like collision avoidance or video streaming. While providing functional separation, this architecture increases weight and power consumption while offering no isolation guarantees, allowing compromises in the companion node to propagate to flight systems.

Merging flight control and companion functions onto a single platform reduces weight, power requirements, and inter-component latency. However, unsupervised consolidation (\gls{uspfs}) introduces critical risks including performance interference (where non-critical tasks disrupt flight-critical operations) and security vulnerabilities (where a single compromise affects the entire system). Consequently, unsupervised consolidation alone cannot meet stringent safety and security requirements.

The supervised approach hypothesizes that hypervisor oversight enables secure consolidation while preserving SWaP advantages. The \gls{sspfs} employs the Bao hypervisor to achieve hardware-enforced isolation between flight control and companion functions, certifiable separation with minimal performance overhead, and retention of single-board SWaP benefits. The following sections detail this architecture's requirements, components, and security model.

\section{Requirements and Constraints}
\label{sec:req-sec}
Video surveillance missions necessitate geolocation control to survey a
designated target area and image acquisition to gather pertinent information
about that region. Both objectives can be achieved through offline or online
command methods, or a combination of the two.

In the offline command approach, the target area and the specific information to
be captured are well-defined and can be comprehensively specified \emph{a
priori} to the \gls{uav}. For instance, in cartographic applications, the UAV
systematically scans the target area to collect topographic data. Consequently,
the UAV can operate in a fully autonomous mode, with data being directly stored
in its onboard storage systems.

Conversely, the online command approach is more suitable for dynamic and
unpredictable environments, where the target area and relevant information are
not fully predefined. For example, in rescue missions, the identification of
targets is critical, necessitating active supervision by the \gls{gcs}. In this
context, the \gls{gcs} must have the capability to remotely control the \gls{uav} and receive real-time feedback, such as telemetry data and live video streams.

This example underscores the critical importance of the online command method,
which involves more stringent operational requirements. As a result, the primary
focus of this work will be on the online command approach.

control and companion functions. Functional constraints prioritize weight

\section{System Architecture}
\label{sec:design-sysArch}
Fig.~\ref{fig:uav-design-conv-sol-1} illustrates the conventional solution ---
\glsxtrfull{umpfs} --- tailored for the video surveillance application, which employs a
separation of concerns. In this approach, the flight controller hardware node
manages flight-critical systems, while the companion computer hardware node
handles secondary and computationally intensive tasks, such as collision
avoidance and prevention, odometry, or, in this case, video streaming to the
\gls{gcs}.

\begin{figure}[!hbt]

  \caption{UAV design: conventional solution --- full}%
  \label{fig:uav-design-conv-sol-1}
\end{figure}

The PX4 flight controller stack was selected for this work due to its
open-source nature, extensive platform support, modular architecture, and
widespread adoption in the industry. PX4 runs on the flight controller on top of
the NuttX \gls{rtos}. In the generic case, the companion computer is used to
route communications between the \gls{gcs} and the \gls{fmu}: a fast serial
link, typically \gls{uart} or Ethernet, is established between the \gls{fmu} and
the companion computer using the MAVLink protocol; the companion computer
runs extra software to route the MAVLink traffic,
e.g. \href{https://github.com/mavlink-router/mavlink-router}{MAVLink
  Router}~\cite{px4-routers}.

The \lstinline{User} interacts with the Ground Control \gls{sw}, namely
\lstinline{QGroundControl}. \lstinline{QGroundControl} was selected due to its
open-source nature and compatibility with the PX4 flight stack. Additionally,
the User can interact with the Companion Computer via offboard
\glspl{api}/\glspl{sdk}, e.g., \lstinline{MAVSDK}. The \gls{rc} link was dropped,
as it is only usable in manual mode, thus, it is not useful for the video
surveillance application.

In the vast majority of cases, extra software, running on the companion
computer, is required to interface the camera, e.g. the \href{https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink-camera-manager}{Mavlink Camera Manager}. This
component acts as bridge between the \gls{fmu} and \gls{gcs} and a translator between the MAVLink Camera Protocol v2
(used by PX4) and the native protocol of the camera~\cite{px4-cam-managers}.

The communications routing poses an increased risk to the \gls{uav}: if the
companion computer is compromised the \gls{fmu} may malfunction due to data
corruption or communication loss. Furthermore, the additional software required
to route MAVLink traffic and manage the camera adds complexity and latency to
the system.

Fig.~\ref{fig:uav-design-conv-sol-2} showcases a simplified conventional
solution customized for video surveillance, with a higher degree of
decoupling. Dedicated
communication links are established for communication between the \gls{gcs} and \gls{fmu} (telemetry radio) and the
camera (Wi-Fi). To streamline the network configuration and eliminate the need
for additional hardware, the \gls{gcs} and the \gls{uav} are integrated into the
same \gls{lan}. The video surveillance software is also simplified consisting of
a client running on the \gls{gcs} and the server running on the companion
computer supported by a suitable video pipeline and device drivers. The
client runs on port 5000 of the \gls{gcs} issuing command for the server running
on the same port in the Companion Computer. The server handles commands and
requests the sender to setup the video pipeline and transmit video frames back
to the \gls{gcs}. The receiver sets up a video pipeline on the \gls{gcs} (not
displayed) that processes the video frames and displays it to the \lstinline{User}.

\begin{figure}[!hbt]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./img/pdf/uav-main-design-conv-sol-2.pdf}

  %\caption[Virtualization mind map]{Virtualization mind map}%
  \caption{UAV design: conventional solution --- simplified}%
  \label{fig:uav-design-conv-sol-2}
\end{figure}

On the receiving end of the video surveillance system (\gls{gcs}), occasional frame loss is tolerable and does not compromise situational awareness of the target area. Consequently, a communication protocol without delivery guarantees, such as \gls{udp}, is appropriate.
%
This simplified conventional solution forms the base design for the platform
unification.

\subsection{Unsupervised Single-Platform Flight Stack}
\label{sec:unsuperv-stack}
Integration of the \gls{fmu} and companion computer platforms requires encapsulation of their functionalities into standalone components within a unified platform. In the \glsxtrfull{uspfs}, these components are abstracted as processes running on a \gls{gpos}.

Fig.~\ref{fig:uav-design-unsup} illustrates the \gls{uspfs} system architecture. Software processes for the \gls{gcs} and \gls{uavic} appear in blue. The \gls{uavic} consolidates both \gls{fmu} and companion computer nodes onto a single platform operating on a \gls{gpos} (specifically Linux), with PX4 executing on core 0 and remaining cores allocated to the video surveillance application.

\begin{figure}[!hbt]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./img/pdf/uav-main-design-unsup.pdf} 
%  \includesvg[width=1.0\textwidth]{./img/virtualization.svg} 
  %\caption[Virtualization mind map]{Virtualization mind map}%
  \caption{UAV design: Unsupervised Single-Platform Flight Stack}%
  \label{fig:uav-design-unsup}
\end{figure}

It is important to note that PX4 no longer runs on the Nuttx \gls{rtos}, which may introduce challenges in meeting the soft real-time requirements of flight control. To address this, one core is explicitly dedicated to the PX4 application. Additionally, employing a real-time Linux kernel with a suitable \gls{io} scheduler can help mitigate timing issues.

However, this architecture lacks isolation between systems, meaning a failure in the non-critical system can propagate to the \gls{fmu}. Such failures could lead to \gls{fmu} malfunctions, potentially resulting in a crash with unpredictable consequences. As mentioned earlier, this solution alone is insufficient; supervision is essential to ensure both reliable consolidation and safe integration.

\subsection{Supervised Single-Platform Flight Stack}
\label{sec:superv-stack}
Fig.~\ref{fig:uav-design-unsup} presents the system architecture of the
\glsxtrfull{sspfs}. In this design, the functionalities of the \gls{fmu} and
companion computer are abstracted as guest \glspl{vm} running atop the Bao
Hypervisor in the \gls{uavic} node. This approach ensures isolation between the two mixed-criticality
systems, preventing faults in the non-critical system from impacting the
\gls{fmu} and causing potential malfunctions.

\begin{figure}[!hbt]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./img/pdf/uav-main-design-sup.pdf} 
%  \includesvg[width=1.0\textwidth]{./img/virtualization.svg} 
  %\caption[Virtualization mind map]{Virtualization mind map}%
  \caption{UAV design: Supervised Single-Platform Flight Stack}%
  \label{fig:uav-design-sup}
\end{figure}

Each \gls{vm} operates a Linux-based \gls{os}, enabling further customization. For instance, the \gls{fmu} \gls{vm} can utilize a real-time kernel, providing additional guarantees that its assigned core remains fully dedicated to its execution. Meanwhile, the Companion \gls{vm} can operate with a standard Linux kernel. Bao's static partitioning mechanism guarantees that the hardware resources assigned to each \gls{vm} are strictly dedicated, ensuring isolation. Moreover, device drivers within each \gls{vm} are specific to that \gls{vm}, minimizing the impact of software bugs or failures.

However, this approach requires each \gls{vm} to include a full \gls{os},
leading to larger binary sizes. Additionally, the \lstinline{User} must carefully
select and allocate hardware resources to avoid conflicts between \glspl{vm}
while maintaining adequate performance in terms of \gls{ram}, available
\glspl{cpu}, and other critical resources. This requires a deeper knowledge
about the hardware used. As such, the system architecture requires later adaptation to the selected hardware.

\section{Hardware Selection}
\label{sec:hardware-selection}
In this section, the hardware for the \gls{uav}, \gls{uavic}, and
extra addons are selected. The hardware is mapped to comply with PX4
requirements and the \gls{uavic} restrictions imposed by Bao.

\subsection{UAV}
\label{sec:uav-hw-sel}
The \gls{uav}'s main characteristics are defined as follows. The multirotor
airframe selection prioritizes low cost, high availability, compactness, and
\gls{vtol} capability. Operation occurs within the \gls{lap} altitude range
(3-9 kilometers). The design requires battery power with minimized weight to
extend flight time. Crucially, an open-source architecture enables user
modification and customization. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:hoverGames-drone} shows the selected \gls{uav} --- the
\lstinline{KIT-HGDRONEK66}, commonly referred to as the NXP HoverGames \gls{uav}
kit~\cite{nxp-hoverGames-uav}. This \gls{diy} professional development kit, priced under
500 USD, features the RDDRONE-FMUK66 as the \gls{fmu} unit (1).

\begin{figure}[!hbt]

  \label{fig:hoverGames-drone}
\end{figure}
%
\fnlicNC{NXP Semiconductors}

The kit is built on an S500 carbon fiber frame with four rotors (quadcopter) and has a 500-millimeter wheelbase (diagonal distance between opposing motors). It employs \gls{bldc} motors (5) to drive the propellers (4), which are controlled by individual \gls{esc} units (4).

For autonomous flight capabilities, the kit includes a \gls{gps} module (3) and a payload mount (7) designed for accessories such as cameras. Power is supplied via a 3S \gls{lipo} battery (sold separately) with a capacity ranging from 3500 to 5000 mAh.

Additionally, a telemetry radio (2), also sold separately, can be connected to
the \gls{fmu} (1). This telemetry module operates in the 433 MHz frequency band
in Europe, enabling remote communication and monitoring.
%
The kit also includes the \gls{rc} remote
controller GS-i6S transmitter and receiver modules.

Fig.~\ref{fig:hoverGames-blkDiag} depicts the block diagram for the NXP
HoverGames \gls{uav} kit.  It features the RDDRONE-FMUK66 \gls{fmu} using the
Kinetis\textreg K66 \gls{mcu} based on the 32-bit Arm\textreg
Cortex\textreg--M4 Core~\cite{nxp-hoverGames-fmu}, running at 180 MHz
with up to 2 MB of flash and 256 KB of \gls{sram}. The \gls{fmu} runs the PX4
autopilot stack.

  \label{fig:hoverGames-blkDiag}
\end{figure}
%
\fnlicNC{NXP Semiconductors}

It includes a power module and power distribution
board with current and voltage sensing to assess the \gls{uav}'s \gls{lipo}
battery autonomy. The power distribution board supplies the \gls{bldc} motors,
controlled by the \gls{esc} unit using \gls{pwm}. A SEGGER J-Link EDU Mini \gls{swd} adapter can
be used to debug the running flight stack or to upload it to the \gls{fmu}. 

It supports common \gls{uav} sensors such as accelerometer, gyrometer,
magnometer, compass, and barometer.
The \gls{fmu} can communicate with a companion computer via \gls{uart}, or with
the \gls{gcs} via the telemetry radio or \gls{rc} link. An optional \gls{sd}
card can be used to support flight logging for offline analysis, debug, and
replay in simulation tools.

\subsection{UAV Integrated Controller}
\label{sec:uav-integr-contr}
The \glsxtrfull{uavic} merges the \gls{fmu} and companion computer functionalities
into a single platform. This consolidation deploys the PX4 autopilot stack and
the video surveillance application into a custom Linux-based OS. However, PX4 was
typically designed to run atop the NuttX \gls{rtos}, with Linux support remaining
limited. Supported platforms include the BeagleBone Blue and Raspberry Pi 2/3/4
with additional shields~\cite{px4-experimental-autopilot}. 

% Fig.~\ref{fig:pilotpi-annot} presents the selected \gls{uavic}: the Raspberry Pi
% 4 with PilotPi shield. This combination was chosen for its detailed documentation
% and cost efficiency.

% The PilotPi shield provides a fully functional open-source
% solution for running PX4 autopilot directly on Raspberry Pi, requiring no
% proprietary drivers while offering open-source \gls{pcb} and
% schematics~\cite{px4-pilotpi}.

% %
% %\fnlicReq{Elsevier}{5457890117132}%
% \fnlicCCFour{foot:pilotpi-annotated}%

% The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (1) operates a Linux-based \gls{os}
% from the \gls{sd} card, directly exposing the \gls{csi} camera and
% \gls{usb} interfaces. This model features the Broadcom BCM2711
% \gls{soc}, containing a 64-bit quad-core Arm\textreg Cortex\textreg--A72 \gls{cpu} at
% 1.8 GHz and VideoCore VI \gls{gpu} at 500 MHz~\cite{rpi4-specs,rpi4-bcm2711},
% with 8 GB LPDDR4-3200 SDRAM. Connectivity includes dual-band 802.11ac wireless,
% Bluetooth 5.0, Gigabit Ethernet, two \gls{usb} 3.0 ports, and two \gls{usb} 2.0 ports.

% The sensor board (2) mounts atop the Raspberry Pi,
% providing \gls{gps}, telemetry, and \gls{rc} external interfaces mapped to
% \lstinline{/dev/ttySC0}, \lstinline{/dev/ttySC1}, and \lstinline{/dev/ttyAMA0},
% respectively. Onboard sensors include an accelerometer/gyroscope
% (\lstinline{ICM42688P}), magnetometer (\lstinline{IST8310}), and barometer
% (\lstinline{MS5611}) required by PX4.

% The topmost layer contains the power board (3), handling power supply (8),
% monitoring (11), and motor actuation via \gls{pwm} (10) supported by the Linux
% \lstinline{PCA9685} driver. A header exposes unused pins, enabling additional
% connections such as a remote serial interface (UART5).

\subsection{Hardware mapping}
\label{sec:hardware-mapping}
The \gls{uavic} platform must comply with PX4 requirements for available
sensors and actuators. Furthermore, the static partitioning nature of the
Bao hypervisor necessitates assessing whether the \gls{uavic} hardware is fully
available to each guest in the \gls{sspfs} solution, or if alternatives are
required. This section therefore proceeds by first mapping the hardware required
by PX4 to the Linux device tree for the \gls{uspfs} solution, followed by
adaptation to comply with Bao constraints in the \gls{sspfs} implementation.


\subsubsection{USPFS}
\label{sec:base-scenario}
Fig.~\ref{fig:hw-map-1} depicts the full device tree for the \gls{uavic} system,
representing the \gls{uspfs} solution (base scenario).
The solid lines represent aggregation, i.e., a node that includes another one
(e.g., the \lstinline{root} node includes the \lstinline{memory} node), and the
dashed lines represent dependency, i.e., a node that depends on another one
(e.g., the \lstinline{power} and \lstinline{firmware} nodes depend on the
\lstinline{mailbox}).

\begin{figure}[!hbt]

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
%
\item \hlighthex{ADD8E6}{000000}{Generic nodes}: essential for all Raspberry Pi
  4 configurations: \lstinline{memory}, \lstinline{cpus},
  \lstinline{power-regulators}, etc.
%
\item \hlighthex{FFE4C4}{000000}{PX4-required nodes}: \lstinline{i2c1} (motor
  actuation), \lstinline{spi0} (\gls{imu}; barometer; magnetometer),
  \lstinline{spi1} (\gls{gps}; telemetry radio), and \glspl{uart} 0/5 (\gls{rc}
  link; debug console)
%
\item \hlighthex{90EE90}{000000}{Companion VM nodes}: \lstinline{i2c0} and
  \lstinline{csi1} (camera interface), \lstinline{mmcnr} (Wi-Fi support)
%
\item \hlighthex{FFB6C1}{000000}{Firmware nodes}: Enable \gls{gpu}-\gls{cpu} communication via \lstinline{mailbox}~\cite{rpi4-fw-mbox}
\end{itemize}

Device tree analysis reveals multiple shared dependencies between PX4 and Companion VM functions: the clock manager (\lstinline{cprman}), \gls{gpio} controller, and \gls{dma} controller. Bao's isolation requirements prohibit device sharing, necessitating architectural alternatives.

The proposed solution maintains PX4's native device requirements while migrating Companion VM devices to the \gls{usb} interface. As shown by the \textcolor{red}{dependency path}, the \lstinline{usb} device (within \lstinline{pcie}) shares only the \lstinline{firmware} node with PX4, which itself depends on the \lstinline{mailbox}.

While this approach simplifies \gls{sspfs} implementation, Bao compatibility remains challenged by the shared \lstinline{mailbox} requirement. Removal of the \lstinline{firmware} node from either \gls{vm} would cause system failure, making this option infeasible.

The adopted approach therefore combines the migration of Companion \gls{vm}
devices to \gls{usb} and the development of supervised mailbox access management within Bao.
This maintains hardware isolation while enabling secure shared resource utilization.

\subsubsection{Supervised mailbox access}
\label{sec:superv-mailb-access}
Fig.~\ref{fig:design-mailbox} illustrates the mailbox access for the
conventional case (left) and the supervised one (right).

\begin{figure}[!hbt]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./img/pdf/uav-main-design-mailbox} 
  \caption{Mailbox access: conventional (left); supervised (right)}%
  \label{fig:design-mailbox}
\end{figure}

The solid lines
indicate synchronous events, while the dashed ones
indicate asynchronous events, with the \textcolor{red}{red} arrows for the
outgoing path as seen by the mailbox driver and the \textcolor{blue}{blue} ones for the
incoming path. The mailbox transactions are represented with white, violet and
grey envelopes for the conventional, VM1 and VM2 interactions. The
synchronization mechanism (lock) is drawn in brown for the mailbox and in blue
for Bao. Hypercalls are represented with a green phone for \lstinline{Start_TX}
hypercall and a red one the \lstinline{End_TX} hypercall. Lastly, the numbering
indicates the sequence of events for both cases.

In the \textbf{conventional case}, the mailbox device driver can initiate a transaction
request if another transaction is not pending complete (1). The transaction must
be completed (8) before a timeout occurs, freeing the mailbox for further
requests. An interrupt is triggered (2) and the \gls{cpu} forwards the request
to the mailbox (3) which requests data from the \gls{gpu} (4). The \gls{gpu}'s
firmware handles the transaction and replies back to the mailbox with the
result (5). The mailbox forwards the response to the mailbox (6, 7) completing
the request and freeing the mailbox~\cite{rpi4-mbox-driver}. 

In the \textbf{supervised case}, the VM1 mailbox driver tries to initiate a
transaction request if another transaction is not pending complete (1). Now,
before sending the transaction, the mailbox driver must signal to Bao it wants
to start it by performing a \lstinline{Start_TX} hypercall (3). Bao acknowledges
this request if another one is not pending complete, locking the mailbox manager
(5). VM2 tries to do the same (2, 4), but, as VM1 acquired the lock, it must
wait for VM1 transaction completion. The Mailbox Manager handles the hypercall,
identifying the guest, the target device address (mailbox), and the interrupt
ID, and injecting the interrupt in the appropriate \gls{cpu} (7). The mailbox
device driver can now send the transaction to the mailbox (8, 9) which will
dispatch it to the \gls{gpu} (10). The \gls{gpu} processes the transaction and
the response it sent back to the device mailbox driver (11, 12, 13). When the
transaction is completed the mailbox driver issues another hypercall ---
\lstinline{End_TX} --- to signal Bao this event, and the mailbox lock is released,
freeing the VM1's mailbox for further requests. Bao handles the hypercall
\lstinline{End_TX} by releasing the mailbox manager's lock (15), which triggers
the pending transaction request issued by VM2 (6) to be resumed by injecting the
interrupt in the appropriate \gls{cpu} (16). Then, the VM2 mailbox's driver can
send the firmware transaction and the process continues.

\subsubsection{SSPFS}
\label{sec:final-scenario}
After addressing shared devices between \glspl{vm} through supervised mailbox management, hardware assignment proceeds as follows.

Fig.~\ref{fig:hw-map-2} and Fig.~\ref{fig:hw-map-3} illustrate the device trees
for the PX4 \gls{vm} and Companion \gls{vm}, respectively.

The PX4 \gls{vm} configuration incorporates only essential onboard
sensors/actuators and an optional debug console. Memory allocation consists of
two \gls{ram} regions: 144 MB and 3 GB. Within the first region, a 32 MB
\gls{cma} region is reserved to support \gls{dma} transactions for \gls{spi}
devices, which operate exclusively within the first GB of
memory~\cite{bcm2711peripherals}. Processing resources include a single Arm A72
\gls{cpu} (core 0).

The Companion \gls{vm} configuration incorporates the \gls{usb} interface for
connecting a \gls{usb} camera and Wi-Fi dongle. Memory allocation features two
\gls{ram} regions: 624 MB and 2 GB. Within the first region, a 384 MB
\gls{cma} region supports video pipeline operations, constrained to the first GB
of memory~\cite{bcm2711peripherals}. Processing resources include three Arm A72
\glspl{cpu} (cores 1--3).

\subsection{Addons}
\label{sec:addons}
The Companion \gls{vm} requires two \gls{usb} devices: a camera and Wi-Fi
dongle. Fig.~\ref{fig:usb-cam} presents the selected \gls{usb} camera -- the
Creative Live! Cam Sync 1080p V2~\cite{creative-cam}.

It is an affordable \gls{usb} camera with full
\gls{hd} video capture (1920x1080 @ 30 \gls{fps}) and dual built-in
microphone. This camera is a plug-and-play device with built-in drivers for
Linux available out of the box. Lastly, due to its long cable it can be
positioned freely in the \gls{uav}. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:usb-wifi} presents the selected \gls{usb} Wi-Fi dongle --- the
EDUP AX3000. This dual high-gain antena device has tri-band support --- 2.4 GHz, 5, and 6
GHz --- and it can achieve data transfer rates
of up to 3000 \gls{mbps} on the \gls{usb} 3.0 interface~\cite{ax3000-specs}. It contains a Mediatek
\lstinline{mt7921au} chipset with a wide \gls{os} compatibility, supported
in-kernel since Linux kernel 5.18~\cite{ax3000-linux}.

% \section{Summary}
% \label{sec:summary}
% Conventional flight stacks address mixed-criticality through multi-platform designs, increasing UAV weight and footprint. Platform integration represents a key design objective, but requires appropriate supervision to be viable.

% This chapter presented three solutions for PX4-based video surveillance applications: conventional (unsupervised multi-platform), unsupervised single-platform (\gls{uspfs}), and supervised single-platform (\gls{sspfs}). The conventional approach established the foundation for platform integration. Subsequent consolidation merged flight controller and companion computer functions into the \gls{uspfs} architecture using a Raspberry Pi 4 with Pilot Pi shield. However, the \gls{uspfs} provides no isolation between systems, allowing failures in non-critical components to propagate to the \gls{fmu}. Platform consolidation with system isolation was therefore achieved through Bao hypervisor supervision, forming the \gls{sspfs} solution.

% Bao's static partitioning requirement creates potential hardware resource conflicts between \glspl{vm}. This challenge was addressed through \gls{uavic} hardware selection and mapping, producing solution-specific device trees. Identified conflicts were resolved by assigning \gls{usb} devices (camera and Wi-Fi dongle) to the companion computer \gls{vm}. One critical shared dependency remainedâ€”the firmware mailbox required for Arm \gls{cpu}-\gls{gpu} communication. A mailbox access supervision mechanism was consequently developed for Bao, enabling both \glspl{vm} to communicate securely with the board's firmware.
