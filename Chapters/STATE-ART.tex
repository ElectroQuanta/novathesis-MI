\label{ch:state-art}
In this chapter some background is provided concerning mixed criticality
systems, its relevance and the challenges it poses, alongside with the current
approach to address its complexity. Next, \glsxtrfull{uav} are discussed,
namely the reference hardware and software, both as open-source and commercial
solutions, and a gap analysis is performed. Lastly, the related work is
presented, showing the current research directions and topics.

\section{Mixed criticality systems}%
\label{sec:mixed-crit-syst}
Embedded systems have stringent requirements both on timing and criticality of
the tasks it performs. The former concerns the task's timing deadlines
requirement (firm, soft, hard), whereas the latter is a
designation of the level of assurance against failure needed for a system
component~\cite{burns2022mixed}. Typical names for the criticality levels are
\glspl{asil}, \glspl{dal}, and \glspl{sil}~\cite{burns2022mixed}.

For example, lets consider an automotive infotainment system that displays
navigation and rear-view camera information. The navigation information is a
commodity for the user, and if, for example, the radio volume suddenly
increases, although uncomfortable, it poses no safety risk for the user. On the
other hand, the rear-view camera information assists the user in parking
maneuvers, and, if a failure occurs, the vehicle may collide causing damage or
harming people.

This is an example of a \gls{mcs}, i.e., a system comprised of computer
\gls{hw} and \gls{sw} that executes several tasks/applications of different
criticality (safety) levels. Furthermore, as this example illustrates, an increasingly relevant trend in the design of real-time and embedded systems
is the integration of mixed-criticality components onto a common hardware
platform while trying to meet the stringent \gls{swap-c} and safety requirements
provided by safety-critical standards, such as those for automotive~\cite{iso26262}, avionics~\cite{rtca1992software},
and railway~\cite{cenelec201250128} industries.

As a result of this integration
complexity increases, requiring higher computational power, and thus, these
\gls{hw} platforms are migrating from single cores to multi-cores and in the
future many-core architectures~\cite{burns2022mixed}. This leads to the
fundamental question of how to reconcile the
conflicting requirements of \emph{partitioning} for (safety) assurance and \emph{sharing} for
efficient resource usage. Consequently, problems arise in the modelling, design,
implementation, and verification of the required \gls{hw} and
\gls{sw}~\cite{burns2022mixed}.

Two major areas of research stem from this dichotomy: a more theorethical one,
largely focused on using criticality-specific \glspl{wcet} to schedule systems
at each criticality level, but at the expenses of high processor utilization; a
more practical one, focused on the safe partitioning of a system with the
sharing of computational and communication resources, but with increased
complexity.
Unfortunately, the combination of both areas is not easy: flexible scheduling
requires, at least, dynamic partitioning, whereas certified systems require
complete separation or, at least, static partitioning. This mismatch needs to be
addressed in future work~\cite{burns2022mixed}.

Another important topic in the \gls{mcs} field is the the incorporation of other
shared resources, e.g.~communication, particulary on multi-core or many-core
platforms: can a shared bus provide the required separation, or is a
Network-on-Chip protocol required? These issues are only now beginning to be addressed~\cite{burns2022mixed}.

\subsection{Virtualization}%
\label{sec:virtualization}
Mixed critical systems require the integration of software components with
disparate criticality levels on a shared \gls{hw} platform. As aforementioned,
the most promising approach is the safe partitioning of the system with shared
computation resources. This leads to concept of virtualization, a logic
abstraction of \gls{hw} resources with isolation guarantees, using different approaches such as
hypervisors, \gls{os}-level virtualization or unikernels~\cite{cinque2022virtualizing}.

Fig.~\ref{fig:virt-mindmap} depicts a map of concepts related to the
virtualization topic, which can be used as reference through this section.

\end{figure}

The major distinction between \gls{os}- and hypervisor-level virtualization is
the former does not provide emulation of the physical \gls{hw}, where the
virtual domain, called container, has its own virtual \gls{hw} resources
(\gls{cpu}, memory, filesystem, network), and process and user management. This
virtual domain acts as an traditional process of an \gls{os}, with its own
independent resources. OS-level virtualization, or containerization, is mostly
used in cloud environments to avoid the replication of the OS stack, further
improving application consolidation on the same
hardware~\cite{cinque2022virtualizing}. Although lacking the \gls{hw} emulation, this
type of virtualization is gaining momentum also in the \gls{rt} systems~\cite{xilinxRunX,struhar2020real} due to
some desirable features like tenant isolation, high-availability,
fault-tolerance, software migration, and recovery techiques. However, these
solutions introduce sources of undeterminism, e.g.~dynamic resources assignment,
have an extensive code base, and lack security features, difficulting its
certification and testing~\cite{cinque2022virtualizing}.

Another option that is gaining popularity is the unikernel-based virtualization,
where it is possible to run a single application in its virtual domain to
increase isolation, performance and security. The full software stack of the
system (\gls{os} components, libraries, language runtime, and application) is
compiled into a single \gls{vm} --- unikernel or library \gls{os} --- which can
be run on the physical hardware, or more commonly, on top of a general-purpose
hypervisor~\cite{cinque2022virtualizing}. Unikernels provide a fast boot time,
low memory footprint, high performance, and strong security by leveraging the
underlying host hypervisor. However, they lack flexibility as applications need
to be manually ported to the underlying unikernel. These solutions require
further studies to enable its adoption in \glspl{mcs},
especially regarding certification and dependability
support~\cite{cinque2022virtualizing}. Fig~\ref{fig:virt-approaches-exs}
illustrates some examples of virtualization approaches: the application,
\gls{rt} and libraries, and the \gls{os} are bundled as a \gls{vm} and run on
top of an hypervisor (hypervisor); a container is formed only with the first two
components and run on top of an \gls{os} (OS-level virtualization); all
components are compiled into a unikernel and run on top of hypervisor
(typically) (unikernel-virtualization).

Cinque et.~al~\cite{cinque2022virtualizing} identified the relationship between hypervisor and guest
\gls{os} combinations, i.e.~the type of guest that runs on top of a hypervisor, and the
associated applications (Fig.~\ref{fig:virt-combos}).
On the left quadrants we have the guest \gls{os} running on top of a general
purpose hypervisor, mainly used for server consolidation in cloud environments
(lower-left), and functional testing and prototyping (upper-left).
On the right quadrants we have a guest \gls{os} on top of a \gls{rt} hypervisor,
mainly used for \gls{qos} and performance analysis (lower-right), and
safety-critical applications (upper-right). The region of interest --- the
\gls{mcs} --- is located in the intersection of these right quadrants,
emphasizing the need of a \gls{rt} hypervisor. Thus, the hypervisors will be
discussed in more detail in the next section.

\subsection{Hypervisors}%
\label{sec:superv--hyperv}
In simple terms a hypervisor is a \glsxtrfull{vmm}, a software layer that
abstracts the \gls{hw} resources in order to run distinct and isolated
application environments, called \glspl{vm} or guests, on the same physical
machine (see Fig.~\ref{fig:virt-approaches-exs}). A \gls{vm} is the execution environment typically comprised of an
\gls{os}, or guest \gls{os}, and the application \gls{sw}.

A hypervisor must guarantee isolation in the following domains~\cite{cinque2022virtualizing}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Temporal}:
  ability to isolate or limit the impact of resource consumption
  (e.g.~\gls{cpu}, network, disk) of a virtual domain on the performance degradation
  of other virtual domains. Thus, a task from one virtual domain must not cause serious
  delays to other tasks in other virtual domain. 
\item \textbf{Spatial} (memory-isolation): ability to isolate code and data
  between virtual domains and between virtual domains and hosts. Thus, a task
  must not be able to modify private data from other tasks, including devices
  assigned to a specific task. It is usually implementated using \gls{hw} memory
  protection mechanisms (e.g., \gls{mmu}, \gls{iommu}).
\item \textbf{Fault}: prevents the propagation of faults from one virtual domain
  to another that could cause blockages or stop the whole system.
\end{itemize}

A hypervisor can be classified in numerous ways (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:virt-mindmap}), as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Host presence}: If the hypervisor is executed on top of an
  existing \emph{host} \gls{os} --- \underline{hosted} --- is classified as type II,
  otherwise as type I --- \underline{bare-metal} ---, running directly on the \gls{hw},
  acting as a classic \gls{os}. The bare-metal hypervisor controls directly the
  hardware resources (e.g.~Jailhouse~\cite{jailhouse}, Bao~\cite{martins_et_al:OASIcs:2020:11779}), whereas the hosted manages it
  indirectly (e.g.~KVM~\cite{kivity2007kvm}, Xen).
\item \textbf{Guest awareness of the hypervisor}: A \underline{fully virtualized} hypervisor
  abstracts completely the \gls{hw} resources to the guest, emulating privileged
  instructions and \gls{io} operations. Thus, it allows a guest OS or an
  application to run unmodified, as they were running directly on the physical
  machine. Typical examples are KVM~\cite{kivity2007kvm} and Microsoft Hyper-V~\cite{microsoftHyperV}. Conversely, in a
  paravirtualized hypervisor (e.g., Xen~\cite{barham2003xen}) the guest \gls{os}
  must communicate with the underlying hypervisor through hypercalls, which is
  cumbersome, since it requires the guest \gls{os} to be modified.
\item \textbf{Real-time support}: this refers to the explicit support for the
  management of the time budget of each \gls{vm} (e.g.~scheduling algorithms)
  which must meet the explicit timing
  constraints~\cite{cinque2022virtualizing}. These hypervisors can be further
  decomposed in \underline{dynamic} (e.g.~KVM\cite{kivity2007kvm},
  Xen~\cite{barham2003xen}) or \underline{static} (e.g.~Jailhouse\cite{jailhouse}, Bao\cite{martins_et_al:OASIcs:2020:11779}), depending on the
  \gls{vm} resources assignment timing: in run-time, as needed, for the former;
  in instantiation time for the latter. Static solutions are often employed for
  \glspl{mcs} due to higher tolerance to failure and less overhead. Moreover, as
  they usually have a small code base they are easier to test and certify
  according to industrial standards~\cite{cinque2022virtualizing}.
\item \textbf{Application type}: embedded, if targeted for a specific application, system, or mission, otherwise they are general-purpose~\cite{heiser2008role}.
\end{enumerate}

Solutions based on hypervisors can be grouped in four categories~\cite{cinque2022virtualizing}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Separation kernel and microkernel}: specially designed for
  industrial and embedded domains. A separation kernel is a special type of a
  very small bare-metal hypervisor defining fixed \glspl{vm} and managing
  information flows, relegating device drivers, user model, shell access and
  dynamic memory to the guest \gls{os}. This simple architecture results in a
  minimal implementation, ideal for a \gls{mcs}. Examples are PikeOS~\cite{pikeOS}, Xtratum~\cite{masmano2009xtratum},
  Jailhouse~\cite{jailhouse}, and Bao~\cite{martins_et_al:OASIcs:2020:11779}.
\item \textbf{General-purpose}: enhancement of general-purpose hypervisors
  (e.g.~KVM~\cite{kivity2007kvm}, Xen~\cite{barham2003xen}) to
  support real-time features.
\item \textbf{Security \gls{cpu} \gls{hw} extensions}: leverage the isolation
  support provided by these hardware extensions (ARM TrustZone, Intel SGX) to attain stricter isolation
  guarantees. For example, ARM TrustZone eanbles virtual virtualization thanks
  to dual world execution model. However, these solutions are strictly linked to the specific
  platforms. Examples are LTZVisor/RTZVisor~\cite{pinto2016towards,rtzvisor} and VOSYSMonitor~\cite{vosysmonitor,lucas2017vosysmonitor}.%
\item \textbf{Unikernel}: runs on top of an hypervisor to enable the execution
  of a single application in its virtual domain, providing isolation,
  performance, and security. Examples are ClickOS~\cite{martins2014clickos} and HermitCore~\cite{lankes2016hermitcore}.
\end{enumerate}

The selection factors for a hypervisor with industrial standards are its footprint, the compliance with
industry safety-related standard, the software license, the explicit support to
high availability, fault tolerance and security, and the supported \gls{hw}
platform~\cite{cinque2022virtualizing}. Cinque et.~al provides an extensive list
of these solutions applied to the \gls{mcs} in order to meet the industrial standards~\cite{cinque2022virtualizing}.

\subsubsection{Bao}%
\label{sec:bao}


Bao (from Mandarin Chinese ``bǎohù'', meaning ``to protect'') is a security and
safety-oriented, lightweight bare-metal hypervisor, developed by the ESRGv3 team
at University of Minho, targeting the embedded real-time domain and especially
the \glspl{mcs} for Armv8 and RISC-V platforms. It follows the pioneer static partioning architecture of
\emph{Jailhouse}~\cite{jailhouse}, and improves it by discarding the need of the
Linux Kernel to boot and manage its \glspl{vm}. From a security and
safety perspective, this dependency compromises the system by bloating the
system \gls{tcb} and intercepting the chain of trust in secure boot
mechanisms~\cite{martins_et_al:OASIcs:2020:11779}. The \glspl{mcs} certification
process is also hindered by the size of and monolithic architecture of such \glspl{os}.

\emph{Jailhouse}'s breakthrough consists in a minimal software layer that
leverages \gls{hw}-assisted virtualization technology to
statically partition all platform resources and assign each one exclusively to a
single \gls{vm} instance at instantiation time. The scheduler can then be
discarded as each virtual core is statically associated to a single physical
CPU, and the complex semantic services are relegated for the \glspl{vm}, further
decreasing the size and complexity. It provides strong isolation and real-time
guarantees but at the expense of efficient resource usage requirement. However,
the Linux dependency is a liability for safety/security and performance too.

Furthermore, the static partioning approach is not enough \emph{per se}, due to
\gls{hw} resources sharing across partitions such as \glspl{llc}, interconnects,
and memory controllers, which breach temporal isolation, hurting performance and
determinism~\cite{bansal2018evaluating,barham2003xen}. A malicious \gls{vm} can exploit this by increasing their
usage of a share resource (\gls{dos} attack) or by indirectly accessing other
gls{vm}'s data thorugh the implicit timing side-channels~\cite{ge2018survey}. To tackle this
issue, some techniques were implemented at both the OS and hypervisor level such
as cache partioning (via locking or coloring), and memory bandwidth
reservations~\cite{martins_et_al:OASIcs:2020:11779}.

Taking this into account Bao was implemented as clean-slate
hypervisor (see Fig.~\ref{fig:bao-arch}), comprising only a minimal thin layer of privileged \gls{sw}
leveraging \gls{isa} virtualization support to implement static partioning of
\gls{hw} resources. Its most relevant features are: memory is statically
assigned using 2-stage translation; \gls{io} is pass-through only; 1:1 mapping
of virtual to physical \glspl{cpu} (no scheduler required); no external
dependencies (except for standard platform management \gls{sw}); provides a
basic mecanism for inter-\gls{vm} communication; \gls{tee} support for increased
security~\cite{martins_et_al:OASIcs:2020:11779,baoEmbeddedWorld2020}.

\begin{figure}[!hbt]

Guest isolation is critical for a \gls{mcs}. Bao achieves complete logical
temporal isolation due to the exclusive CPU mapping, discarding the scheduler,
and the availability of per-\gls{cpu} architectural timers directly managed by
the guests. Spatial isolation is provided by the 2-stage \gls{hw} virtualization
support for the logical address space isolation. The translation overhead, page
table and \gls{tlb} pressure is minimized using superpages, whenever
possible, faciliting speculative fetch for potential guest performance
improvement. A page coloring mechanism was implemented to enable \gls{llc}
cache partioning independently for each \gls{vm}, but at the expenses of memory
waste and fragmentation, and increased boot time~\cite{martins_et_al:OASIcs:2020:11779}.

The \gls{io} are directly assigned to guests in a pass-through only
configuration. For the memory-mapped IO architectures, as the ones supported, it
uses the existing memory mechanism and 2-stage translation provided by the
virtualization support to implement this for free. A peripheric can be shared
among guests, as exclusive assignment is not checked~\cite{martins_et_al:OASIcs:2020:11779}.

The interrupt virtualization support is restricted to the Arm \gls{gic}v2 and
Arm \gls{gic}v3, which does not support direct interrupt delivery to guest
partitions. Instead, all interrupts
are dispatched to the hypervisor, which then must re-inject them into the guest \gls{vm} using
a limited set of pending registers, leading to unavoidable increase in both
interrupt latency and the complexity of interrupt management code~\cite{martins_et_al:OASIcs:2020:11779}. This was
fixed in the newest version of the specification~\gls{gic}v4 which bypasses the hypervisor for guest interrupt delivery~\cite{dall2018design}.

It is also noteworthy to mention that Xen has recently introduced
\emph{Dom0-less}, eliminating the Linux dependency to boot and execute its
hypervisor and \glspl{vm}. Nonetheless, Bao currently provides the same
features but with a smaller \gls{tcb} and with clean security
features. Moreover, and although being in its infancy, preliminary evaluation
demonstrate only minimal virtualization overhead~\cite{martins_et_al:OASIcs:2020:11779}.
Lastly, Bao is open-source~\cite{baoRepo} due to the developing team's strong
belief that security requires transparency. For all the aforementioned reasons,
Bao is the hypervisor of choice to use in this work. Tab.~\ref{tab:bao-summary}
provides a summary of the Bao hypervisor.

\section{Unmanned Aerial Vehicles}%
\label{sec:unmann-aeri-vehicl}
\glsxtrfull{uav}s, \glsxtrfull{uas}, or more commonly drones, are a class of
unmanned robotic vehicles that can execute flying missions and carry payloads,
guided either by remote control stations or in an autonomous
way~\cite{alladi2022UAVBlockain,glossner2021overview}.
They belong to a broader class of \glspl{uv}, alongside with \glspl{ugv}, \glspl{usv}
(e.g., boats) and \glspl{uuv}~\cite{glossner2021overview}.

\glspl{uav} date back to as far as the 18\textsuperscript{th} century. In 1783,
France, the first uncrewed aircraft --- a hot air balloon ---
was publicly displayed~\cite{Blundell2020,alladi2022UAVBlockain}. In 1896, Alfred Nobel created the first camera-based \gls{uav}
(rocket) and launched it. In 1935, U.K., the first modern \gls{uav} was
developed, a low cost radio controlled aircraft. The term \emph{drone} was
presumably coined by Lieutenant Commander Fahrney, who as in charge of U.S. Navy
program \emph{Radio Controlled Aircraft}~\cite{Blundell2020}. The first \gls{uav} designed for
surveillance and scouting was developed in 1973 in Israel, and the \emph{Gulf
  War} was the first conflict utilizing \glspl{uav}. Starting from 2003,
the \gls{uav} commercial market started to emerge with the release of the
\emph{Amazon Prime}~~\cite{alladi2022UAVBlockain}.
However, it was until 2006 that the \glspl{uav} were first
permitted in the U.S. civilian space. More recently, in 2010, the first
smartphone controlled quadcopter was developed, and in 2013 camera equipped
\glspl{uav} entered the consumer market~\cite{uavHistory}.

From then on, the selling price dropped significantly, alongside with the
emergence of some of the first open-source projects on \gls{uav} control ---
ArduPilot in 2008~\cite{arduPilotHistory} and Dronecode~\cite{px4History} (now PX4) in 2011 --- led to a boom in the
commercial \gls{uav} market. In 2017 the North America market had a revenue of
737 million USD dollars and a eight-fold increase is expected for 2026 with a
staggering 6.7 billion USD dollars, with strong contributions from the sectors
of agriculture and farming, and security and law enforcement~\cite{mohsan2022towards}.

The versatility and utility of \glspl{uav} are well displayed is by its wide
range of applications, performing tasks with high added value and that would be
somewhat hard or impossible for a person to achieve: rescue operations and
saving lifes, agriculture and farming, building structures, pipeline
inspections, delivering goods and medical supplies, video capturing and filming,
surveying, inventory management, providing telecommunications in remote areas,
among others~\cite{alladi2022UAVBlockain}.

However, only recently regulations have been explicitly enforced on \glspl{uav},
with many countries allowing drones to fly over populated areas (at altitudes
lower than 150 m)~\cite{nassi2021sok}. For example, in 2019, the E.U.~stated that all drones under
25 kgs are able to fly without prior authorization under some constraints. On
the other hand, it imposed that all drones must register in their respective
states, and that each state must define no-fly zones where drones are
forbidden to enter~\cite{Ullah2020UAV5gEULegisl}. Broadly, five important categories must be considered when
analyzing the \gls{uav}
regulations~\cite{fotouhi2019UAVCellularCommSurvey,stocker2017UAVRegulationsReview}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Applicability}: refers to the applicable scope of \gls{uav} regulations,
  typically including type, weight, and role of the \gls{uav}; 
\item \textbf{Operational limitations}: restricts the locations for \gls{uav} operations.
\item \textbf{Administrative and legal requirements}: set of rules and
  regulations to monitor the use of \glspl{uav}.
\item \textbf{Technology specifications/requirements}: mechanical,
  communications and control capabilities that ensure its safe operation.
\item \textbf{Moral and ethics}: refers to the privacy and security of people in
  general.
\end{enumerate}

Furthermore, no global regulation for \gls{uav} standardization exists. Thus, in
2020 \gls{faa} in collaboration with \gls{nasa} and other agencies published the
\gls{utm} 2.0, describing protocols for enabling multiple, \gls{bvlos}
drone operations with the same airspace.

\subsection{Classification}%
\label{sec:classification}
An \gls{uav} can be classified in multiple ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Thrust forces \& Flight principles}: \glspl{uav} can be lighter
  than air, e.g., a balloon or a blimp if it uses a motorized propulsion
  system. On the other hand, if they are heavier than air, we have
  gliders, rotor-crafts, and birds~\cite{mohsan2022towards}.
 % 
\item \textbf{Airframe}: probably the most noticeable external feature of a
  \gls{uav} is its chassis, or airframe. Several airframes exist for different
  applications from three main types: fixed-wing, rotor, and
  hybrid. Fixed-wing can travel faster than all other types of \glspl{uav} due
  to its aerodynamics and propulsion system, can carry heavy payloads, and have
  long autonomy. However, they require takeoff and landing from a runway. They
  are typically used for power line inspections and aerial mapping. Single rotor
  and multirotor \gls{uav} can hover and do \gls{vtol}. The single rotor long
  autonomy, but are expensive, require skilled operators, and are mechanically
  complex and vulnerable to vibrations. Multirotors, on the other hand, are the
  cheapest and most manufactured ones, but they typically have low autonomy
  since they consume more power. They can have a varied number of propelers,
  such as tricopter, quadcopter, hexacopter, and octocopter~\cite{mohsan2022towards}.
 % 
\item \textbf{Altitude}: Broadly, \glspl{uav} are divided into \glspl{lap} and
  \glspl{hap}~. A \gls{lap} maximum altitude ranges from 3 to 9 kms and is
  typically used to support cellular communications. \glspl{hap}, on the other
  hand, are deployed above the 9 km altitude and are used to support cellular
  communication but with wider coverage, endorsed by companies such as Google
  and Facebook~\cite{mohsan2022towards}.
%  
\item \textbf{Overall weight}: \glspl{uav} can have few grams of weight or
  hundreds of kilograms. For example, Australia labels them as \emph{micro}
  (below 100 g),
  \emph{very small} (from 100 g to 2 kg), \textbf{small} (from 2 to 25 kgs),
  \textbf{medium} (from 25 to 150 kgs), and \textbf{large} (over
  150 kgs)~\cite{alladi2022UAVBlockain}.
%  
\item \textbf{Power source}: \glspl{uav} can be powered using electricity,
  fuel, or a hybrid solution. Except for the fuel-only powered ones (e.g., Nitro
  Stingray, and Goliath Quadcopter~\cite{gasPoweredDrone}), all the
  others use electric motors. These motors can be powered through batteries
  (e.g., Parrot\cite{parrotDrone}, Dji Mavic 3~\cite{djiMavic3Drone}),
  typically \gls{lipo}, \glspl{hfc} (e.g., Energyor H2Quad 1000~\cite{energyorDrone}), and solar power. The
  hybrid solutions use fuel + batteries (e.g., Flaperon MX8~\cite{flaperonDrone}) or \gls{hfc} + batteries, and are a compromise between the
  two power sources. Batteries typically have the shortest autonomy and are
  heavy and bulky, while fuel, although not a clean power source, has the
  highest power density, leading to higher autonomy. The hydrogen fuel cells are
  a intermediate solution, but are typically more expensive than batteries and
  have more complex power management.
%  
\item \textbf{Target audience}: \glspl{uav} are developed with a specific target
  audience in mind, namely the recreational/hobbyist, the commercial, and
  military one.
%  
\item \textbf{User-modifiable}: In 2021, 26\% of all commercial drones sold were
  open-source (e.g., Parrot)~\cite{droneAnalyst2021}. There is an increased trend for open-source
  adoption due to higher transparency, extensability and usage from the end-user
  perspective, and due to bootstrapping opportunity since the developers can
  leverage from the ecosystem, e.g., using the flight control algorithms which
  are hard and costly to develop. On the side of the spectrum, we have
  proprietary drones (e.g., Dji) with the highest market share. Transparency is
  compromised and extensibility is typically provided using a \gls{sdk}~\cite{djiSDK}.
\end{itemize}

Fig.~\ref{fig:uav-types} illustrates the several types of \glspl{uav}, focusing
on airframe and power source.

The most prominent \gls{uav}'s characteristics are speed, autonomy, payload,
range, and altitude. The speed depends mainly on the propulsion system,
aerodynamics, weather conditions and power usage. Typically, a small
\gls{uav} can reach speeds up to 50 km/h, while a large one can reach speeds up
to 360 km/h\cite{mohsan2022towards}.
The autonomy or endurance, refers to the maximum flight time with a
single charge (battery, fuel, or both), varying from a 20--30 minutes (small \glspl{uav}) to several
hourse (large \glspl{uav}). Size, weight and weather conditions have a strong
impact on the autonomy. Some technologies are currently being develop to support
in-flight recharging through renewalable sources (\gls{pv} cells) or wireless
power techniques (e.g., laser emission)\cite{mohsan2022towards}.
The payload refers to the lifting capability of the \gls{uav} for load carrying,
varying from few grams (small \glspl{uav}) to hundreds of kilograms (large
\glspl{uav}). Most common payloads are sensors and video cameras~\cite{mohsan2022towards}.
The range defines the distance from where the \gls{uav} can be controlled
remotely and depends on the communication technology and network, and the
weather conditions\cite{mohsan2022towards}. The altitude is the height a drone can fly, weather by
technological constraints or by legal ones~\cite{mohsan2022towards}.

generic overview, summarizing its main concepts.

\subsection{System overview}%
\label{sec:system-overview}
Fig.~\ref{fig:uav-sysOverv} shows an overview of the \gls{uav} system and its
ecosystem. At the center \emph{(1)} we have the \gls{uav} and its flight control
\gls{hw} and \gls{sw}. Its main tasks are path planning, communication
management, data acquisition, and mission~\cite{aggarwal2020UAVPathPlanning}. The path planning works in
combination with the \gls{gcs} to assist in the navigation, finding the optimal
path, while providing environmental awareness through weather and climate
monitoring, and controlling the motion and speed for obstacle avoidance. To
achieve this, the
on-board \underline{flight controller} collects data from multiple sensors
(e.g., ultrasonic/infrared sensors for obstacle avoidance,
\gls{imu}, barometer, \gls{gnss}/\gls{gps} module, etc.) and,
together with the commands received from the \gls{gcs}, implements attitude
estimation and the control law (e.g., Kalman filter) to drive the propulsion
system (motors) (2). The flight controller also manages the communications
between three types of links~\cite{aggarwal2020UAVPathPlanning}: \underline{\gls{uav} to \gls{gcs}} (5) --- radio
communication used for transmitting instrument readings such as audio or video
and for human remote control (7) (8); \underline{\gls{uav}
  to Satellite} (4) --- carries weather, climate, and \gls{gps} information
  required for accurate \gls{uav} navigation; \underline{\gls{uav} to \gls{uav}}
  (6) --- can be used for cooperative missions or to provide environmental
  awareness (e.g., signal danger). The mission refers to the flight's goal,
  e.g., video capturing, topographic mapping, etc., and is directly related to
  the payload (3) (e.g., camera, LIDAR, etc.).

\begin{figure}[!hbt]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./img/pdf/uav-sys-overv.pdf}

  %\caption[Virtualization mind map]{Virtualization mind map}%
  \caption{UAV system overview}%
  \label{fig:uav-sysOverv}
\end{figure}

Sensors can be typically categorized into obstacle avoidance, payload, and
navigation~\cite{VogeltanzFreeSWUAVSurvey2016}. Ultrasonic and infrared sensors are generally used to avoid
collisions with obstacle, but \gls{tof} sensors like LIDAR can also be used,
although more expensive and more complex. The navigational sensors include the
\gls{imu} --- used to estimate orientation and heading of the vehicle, the
barometer --- used to estimate of the \gls{uav} with a precision of few
centimeters, and the \gls{gnss}/\gls{gps} module --- used to estimate the
drone's geolocation for navigation and autonomous flight with a precision of up
to 5 meters, thus requiring the \gls{imu} and barometer to improve accuracy~\cite{ebeidUAVPlatformsSurvey2017}.

The actuators depend on the propulsion system, although electronic drives are
always used. For a typical multi-rotor \gls{uav}, \glspl{bldc} motors are used
for rotors, with an \gls{esc} --- an gls{ac}/\gls{dc} power converter and
high-frequency variable motor speed controller. Fixed-wing hybrids include also
servomotors for flaps~\cite{gabrielBLDCFixedWingUAV2011}.

Fig.~\ref{fig:uav-sysOverv-tasks-mindmap} depicts the concept map of \gls{uav}'s
tasks and components.

  \caption{UAV mind map: System overview --- Tasks and components}%
  \label{fig:uav-sysOverv-tasks-mindmap}
\end{figure}

\glspl{uav} can be organized into a top-down hierarchy of layers~\cite{glossner2021overview}, as follows
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:uav-sysOverv-hierarc-mindmap}):
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Flight Supervision}: the topmost layer handles flight's
  management, safety/authorization, and remote \gls{uav}'s
  identification. \underline{Flight management} is achieved through the
  transmission of commands from the \gls{gcs} to the \gls{uav}'s \gls{fcs}. The \gls{gcs} is
  software running on ground-control devices, and they typically provide path
  planning, mapping and real-time flight statistics superimposed on a map. The
  most notable example is probably \texttt{QGroundControl}, which provides full
  flight control and setup for \gls{uav} vehicles, cross-platform, and with a
  mobile-styled \gls{ui}. It supports actions to be triggered in case of
  failures (fail-safe features), such as geofencing (limits the permissible fly
  areas). \underline{Safety/authorization} handles the authorization to fly (if
  required) and its safety. Although autopilots, like PX4 and ArduPilot,
  and the \gls{gcs} exist, providing several safety features, the pilot in
  control is ultimately responsible for ensuring the safe flight of any
  \gls{uav}. As such, it must enforce the use of failsafe actions, like in the
  case of low battery, loss of \gls{rc} signal, data link failures, or geofence
  violations, and request authorization to fly if legally demanded. For example,
  pilots can use \texttt{LAANC} \glspl{api} or \texttt{Google Wing OpenSky} to
  receive \gls{faa} authorization for entering controlled airspace. On the other
  hand these softwares provides the air traffic professionals drones operations'
  visibility.
  \underline{Remote identification} will be required for all \glspl{uav}
  beginning in 2023. Thus, all \glspl{uav} must be equipped to a \gls{rid}, an
  unique electronic identifier comparable to a vehicle license plate, with direct
  broadcasting of the \gls{rid} to anyone within range of signal.
\item \textbf{Command \& Control}: the second layer ensures drones can fly
  safely, through the transmission of commands to the \gls{uav}, yielded by an
  human operator of computer-generated via autopilot. The command is sent to the
  \gls{uav} via proprietary protocols or open \glspl{api} (e.g., MAVLink
  \gls{sdk} or Parrot \gls{sdk}). The autopilot consists in \gls{sw} stack
  running on the \gls{fcs}. Noticeable open-source autopilots are
  \texttt{PX4}, \texttt{ArduPilot}, and \texttt{{Paparazzi}}.
\item \textbf{System Simulation}: \gls{uav} behavior is analyzed in respect to
  different environment and conditions, mainly through \underline{flight
    modeling},
  \underline{traffic modelling} --- models real-world traffic interactions
  (land and air) --- and
  \underline{network communication modelling}. 
\item \textbf{Operating Systems}: \glspl{os} are used to interface the
  electronic \gls{hw} that controls \gls{uav} operation through a tractable
  abstraction. \glspl{uav} can a myriad of \glspl{os}, both open-source --- such as
  \gls{ros}, \texttt{Linux}, \texttt{FreeRtos}, \texttt{NuttX}, \texttt{ChibiOS} --- or proprietary, like \texttt{VxWorks}. 
\item \textbf{Physical \gls{hw}}: comprises the actual electronic \gls{hw} of
  the \gls{uav}, such as sensors, motors, communications, etc.
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Security and Safety}%
\label{sec:security-safety}
Another very important feature, often overlooked, is the \gls{uav}'s ecosystem
security, and alongside with it safety of people and goods~\cite{leccadito2018survey}. Security is often
not embedded in the system's design, posing all sorts of problems. For example,
\glspl{uav} often include onboard wireless communication modules that use open,
unencrypted, and unauthenticated channels, exposing them to a variety of
cyber-attacks~\cite{kishnaCyberVulnerUAVReview2017,mansfieldUAVCyberThreats2013}.
The problem is not restricted to
commercial applications, with the U.S. army banning Dji drones --- the most
widely used ones by the army --- for cybersecurity
concerns in 2017~\cite{suasNewsDjiDronesBanned2017}. Hacking of drones is
another major concern, exposing sensitive information and control of the
\gls{uav}. In fact, several incidents have been reported in the media where
drones were weaponized~\cite{spiegelUAVAccident2015,nytimesUAVAccident2018,theDriveUAVAccident2019}, and the volume and risk of such incidents are
likely to increase significantly with the expected drone market growth in the
foreseable future~\cite{mohsan2022towards}and the new regulations adopted by many countries which allow
drones to fly over populated areas~\cite{stocker2017UAVRegulationsReview}.

The most common attacks to the  \gls{uav} are \gls{dos} and \gls{ddos}, causing
resource availability challenges which can be exploited to drain the batteries,
overload the processing units, and flood the communications link, leading to
huge services' interruption~\cite{mohsan2022towards}. But more sophisticated attacks are used too, like
\gls{gps} spoofing --- impersonating as a valid \gls{gps} satellite to provide
false data, \gls{gps} jamming, instrument spoofing (gyroscope, compass), or even
killing the main process~\cite{nassi2021sok}. Ground control stations are a target too, since the
attacker can indirectly obtain access to the \gls{uav}, usually through key
loggers, viruses, and malwares,  and steal all of its data or send malicious
and erroneous commands to the \gls{uav}~\cite{mohsan2022towards}.

Nassi et al.~\cite{nassi2021sok} conducted a thorough and very extensive survey
on the security and privacy issues associated with \glspl{uav}, the attacks and countermeasures. The authors
divided the security attacks on two categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Targetting \glspl{uav}}: corresponds to an attack an
  ill-intentioned civilian performs on an \gls{uav} using, e.g., an \gls{sdr}, a
  computer or a commercial laser. Six targets were identified --- the \gls{uav}
  electronic \gls{hw}, the \gls{uav} chassis and package (e.g., propelers and
  cargo), the \gls{gcs}, the \gls{fpv} channel, the pilot and cloud
  services/servers. Attacks on the \gls{uav} \gls{hw} include installation of
  fake firmware, instrument spoofing and \gls{gps} jamming. Countermeasures vary
  with each attack, but, for example, the installation of fake firmware on the
  device can be opposed by requiring the digital signature of the firmware
  before installing. Direct attacks to interrupt \gls{uav}'s flight control and
  commiunications links to modify mission parameters can be mitigated through
  onboard \gls{sw} and \gls{hw} mechanisms, such as real-time monitoring,
  instantaneous estimation of the controller, alert warning and immediate action
  on any alteration from the intended controller model~\cite{mohsan2022towards}.
  Attacks on the chassis and package include fake \gls{cad}
  files to undermine its fabrication and deployment, especially critical for
  open-source \gls{hw}, nets, and bullets. They can be opposed by requiring
  digital signature and by using parachutes, respectively.
  The \gls{fpv} channel is the radio communication channel between the \gls{uav}
  and the \gls{gcs}, which enables the pilot to fly as if it was on board and
  consists of a downlink --- used for video streaming --- and an uplink --- used
  to control the \gls{uav} via the \gls{gcs}. The most known methods are
  pilot's deauthentication, taking and dowloading videos and pictures, killing
  the main process, or remote control of the drone, which can be mitigated
  through the usage of an encrypted network protocol. Jamming is also an issue
  and can be remediated using channel hopping. Lastly, cloud services and
  servers expose the \gls{uav} indirectly to hackers, because, although most
  \glspl{uav} are not connected to the Internet, the \gls{gcs} is, sending the
  telemetry of flights to cloud servers for storage and analysis. The methods
  used to explore this link are deanonymizing pilots and extracting flight
  history, which can be both mitigated through the implementation of
  authorization and two-factor authentication mechanisms.
\item \textbf{Targetting people}: \glspl{uav} can attack people, on a
  individual, organization or nation base. The countermeasures include
  \underline{detection and tracking}, \underline{assessment}, and
  \underline{interdiction}. Several detection methods exist, such as radars,
  video and infrared cameras, LIDAR, acoustics, acoustics and optics,
  etc. However, it is important to note that none of these methods are
  fail-proof. For example, specific radars have to be used with very specialized
  operators, since common radars are designed for large aircraft detection and
  drones uses materials which are not very radio reflective. Another example is
  the acoustics, where sensors exist to detect the specific spectrum of the
  drone's propellers, but can be easily circumvented by going into silent
  (stealth) mode~\cite{sathyamoorthy2015review}. Assessment concerns the rating
  and identification of hostile drones, especially important in areas where
  drones are used for both legal and illegal activies. The most used methods are
  based on \gls{uav}'s classication, to identify the manufacturer and model of
  the drone. In the event of the detection and assessment of a hostile drone,
  interdiction must be applied, i.e., the drone should be disabled. For this
  purpose, several methods can be used like bullets and nets, which are
  dangerous and not very effective, commercial jammers, predator birds and laser
  cannons.
\end{itemize}

Safety failures are also very serious, since they pose risks on the integrity of
people and goods. They can be categorized as follows~\cite{ferrao2020stuart}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Damague due to calculation errors}: occurs when a \gls{uav} is
  more dangerous than planned. For example, in 2020 in the U.K., an activist
  group piloted hundreds of drones with the 3-mile depletion zone to interrupt
  the flights, which could have been catastrophic.
\item \textbf{Sensor failures}: \gls{uav} sensors do not easily detect delicate
  objects, such as wires, tree branches, and transparent surface such as
  buildings windows. Falls by collisions with these types of objects are very
  common due to undetected obstacle or pilot's excess of confidence.
\item \textbf{Obstacle deviation}: collisions and crashes caused by object
  deviation are common, from building to trees.
\item \textbf{Direct attacks}: these attacks are performed to harm people, for
  personal or ideological reasons, or to steal the \gls{uav} payload, e.g., an
  organ, food, or vaccines. The recreational/hobbyist \glspl{uav} are the most
  commonly targets.
\item \textbf{Accidental damage}: can occur when a \gls{uav} gets out of
  control, due to legitimate loss of control by the owner, cyber attack, or
  \gls{sw} or \gls{hw} malfunction. Indepently of the cause, the extent of the
  damage on people as goods can be severe, due to crash of \gls{uav} falling
  from the sky.
\end{itemize}

Clearly, security and safety are fundamental aspects of the \gls{uav}'s
operation, but they require more effort to decrease the attack vectors and the
attack surface. Ferrão proposed that \gls{uav}'s design considers simultaneously
both aspects, as they strongly influence each
other~\cite{ferrao2020stuart}. Fig.~\ref{fig:uav-security-mindmap} illustrates the
\gls{uav}'s security and safety taxonomy.

\subsection{UAV Reference Hardware}%
\label{sec:uav-ref-hw}
In this section the reference hardware for \glspl{uav} is discussed. An overview
and the \gls{hw} architecture is presented. Then, the open-source and
commercial solutions are discussed, and compared in the gap-analysis.

\subsubsection{Overview and Architecture}%
\label{sec:overv-arch-hw}
Fig.~\ref{fig:uav-hw-arch} illustrates the high-level abstraction of the
\gls{uav} \gls{hw} architecture~\cite{leccadito2018survey,px4-sysArch}. In orange, we have the main computing
platforms: the flight controller (\gls{fcs}), e.g., Pixhawk, and, optionally,
the companion computer, which provides extra functionalities like navigation ---
avoidance and collision prevention, mission-related features --- associated to
the payload, e.g., camera surveillance, topographic mapping, etc. --- or
telemetry data processing, off-loading the \gls{fcs}.

The \gls{fcs} is typically composed of a main processor, for \gls{uav} control,
and a optionally fall-safe coprocessor, dedicated to fail-safe features, i.e., the actions that
must be triggered in case of a failure, e.g., returning to base when the
battery reaches the low threshold. The main processor handles the communications
--- commands arriving from the manual \gls{rc} controller or between the
companion computer, the control of the aircraft --- typically using \gls{pid}
models and/or estimation methods (e.g., Kalman filter), and the \gls{io} --- to
interface the critical sensors, such as \gls{imu}, barometer, gyroscope, and
compass, or the actuators, such as \gls{bldc} motors and servomotors. The power
system supplies the required energy for computing and \gls{io}.

As aforementioned, the flight controller does not explicitly require the
companion computer, since the commands sent manually by the pilot
through the \gls{rc} controller are sufficient to control the aircraft flight
(\gls{los} navigation). However, for autonomous missions --- autopilot --- the non-critical
sensors like the \gls{gps}, and obstacle avoidance sensors, are required. In
this mode, the companion computer sends telemetry data to the \gls{gcs}, which
are typically superimposed on a map for straightforward navigation and receives
the navigational and mission-related commands, processing them and dispatching
the lower level commands to the flight controller or \gls{io} system.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Open-source solutions}%
\label{sec:open-source-solut-hw}
\glsxtrfull{osh} solutions have been developed to provide more transparency,
extensibility, flexibility, maintenability, while trying to be
cost-effective. \gls{osh} means that the \gls{hw} design (i.e., mechanical
drawings, schematics, \gls{bom},\gls{pcb} layout data, \gls{hdl} source code),
and the \gls{sw} that drives the \gls{hw}, are all released under free/libre
terms~\cite{freeGNU}.
The user can purchase or manufacture the \gls{hw} components
individually or in \gls{cots} kits.

The \gls{osh} solutions fall into three main categories: ARM-based platforms,
Atmel-based platforms, and RaspberryPi-based
platforms~\cite{ebeidUAVPlatformsSurvey2017}. However, the currently active
\gls{osh} projects are based only in ARM platforms, such as, \texttt{Pixhawk 4},
\texttt{Paparazzi Chimera}, \texttt{CC3D}, and \texttt{CUAV v5 Plus}, among
others.

  Pixhawk is a company that develops open standards for drone
  hardware, providing readily available \gls{hw} specifications and guidelines
  for drone development. \texttt{Pixhawk 4} is an advanced autopilot designed in
  collaboration with Holybro {\gls{hw} manufacturer} and the PX4 (open-source
  autopilot \gls{sw}) teams~\cite{pixhawk4}, released under the \gls{bsd} license (see Fig.~\ref{fig:osh-pixhawk4}). It is optimized to run PX4 v1.7 and
  laterm and is suitable for academic and commercial developers. It runs PX4 on
  the NuttX \gls{os}~\cite{pixhawk4}. It consists of two 32-bit ARM processors
  for the \gls{fcs} (\gls{fmu}, 32-bit Arm Cortex M7 @ 216 MHz, 2 MB memory, 512
  KB \gls{ram}) and \gls{io} (32 bit Arm Cortex-M3 @ 24 MHz, 8 KB \gls{sram}),
  respectively~\cite{pixhawk4}. It comes with on-board sensors
  (accelerometers/gyroscopes, magnetometer, and barometer) and a \gls{gps}
  module. It has \gls{pwm}, \gls{can} \gls{i2c}, \gls{uart}, \gls{spi}, and
  telemetry interfaces (radio and companion computer)~\cite{pixhawk4}.

  The \texttt{Paparazzi Chimera} is an \gls{osh} flight controller released
  under the \gls{gpl} license~\cite{paparazziChimera} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:osh-paparazzi-chimera}).
  This flight controller integrates all \gls{io} in the same board, and it uses the ARM Cortex-M7 STM32F767 @ 216 MHz (2 MB Flash,
  512 Kb \gls{sram}) \gls{mcu}. It comes with on-board sensors
  (\gls{imu}, barometer, and pressure sensure), an XBEE modem holder for
  communications, and a dedicated serial link and power supply for the companion
  computer (e.g., Beaglone, RaspberryPi, etc.). It has \gls{pwm}, \gls{can}
  \gls{i2c}, \gls{uart}, \gls{spi}, and servomotors interfaces~\cite{pixhawk4}.
  
  The \texttt{CC3D} is an \gls{osh} flight controller released
  under the \gls{gpl} license~\cite{cc3d} (see
  Fig.~\ref{fig:osh-cc3d}), running the \texttt{OpenPilot} firmware. It uses a STM 32-bit \gls{mcu} @ 90
  MHz (128 kB Flash and 20 kB \gls{sram}). It comes with on-board gyroscope and
  accelerometers, support to serial and \gls{usb} telemetry, up to ten motors,
  and provides camera stabilization.
  
  \texttt{CUAV v5 Plus} is an advanced autopilot supporting the
  \texttt{ArduPilot} firmware~\cite{arduPilot-cuavV5}, released under the \gls{bsd} license (see Fig.~\ref{fig:osh-pixhawk4}). It consists of a 32-bit ARM processor
  for the \gls{fcs} (\gls{fmu}, 32-bit Arm Cortex M7 @ 216 MHz, 2 MB Flash, 512
  KB \gls{ram}) and a 32-bit IOMCU coprocessor. It comes with on-board sensors
  (accelerometers/gyroscopes, magnetometer, and barometer) and a \gls{gps}
  module. It has \gls{pwm}, \gls{can} \gls{i2c}, \gls{uart}, \gls{spi} interfaces~\cite{arduPilot-cuavV5}.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Commercial solutions}%
\label{sec:commercial-solutions-hw}
The commercial term here refers to the proprietary nature of the \gls{hw},
opaque to the end-user. The
lack of transparency can be an issue, raising suspicions, like the on-going ban
of the U.S. Army to the Dji
drones~\cite{suasNewsDjiDronesBanned2017,djiBan2022}. Nonetheless, proprietary
solutions represent 70\% of the market share, with Dji being the biggest
manufacturer~\cite{droneAnalyst2021}.

The commercial solutions can be classified into the following categories:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{ARM-based platorms}: The \texttt{SPRacing H7 Extreme} is a low-end
  flight controller running \texttt{ArduPilot} \gls{sw} stack (see Fig.~\ref{fig:hw-SPRacing}). It features 
  an STM32F750 ARM 32-bit \gls{mcu} @ 400 MHz, and comes with on-board sensors
  (dual \gls{imu}, barometer). It supports \gls{i2c}, \gls{uart}, \gls{spi},
  micro \gls{usb}, and camera interfaces~\cite{arduPilot-SPRacing}.
%  
\item \textbf{\gls{fpga}-based solutions}:
  The \texttt{Aerotenna OcPoC-Zynq Mini} is a \gls{fpga} + ARM \gls{soc} based
  flight control platform (Xilinx Zynq Z-7010),  which supports ArduPilot and PX4 \gls{sw}
  stacks~\cite{ocpoc} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:hw-ocpoc}).
  The \gls{fpga} \gls{io}'s flexibility allows for rapid sensor integration and
  customization of the flight controller \gls{hw}, adding capabilities
  such as triple redundancy in \gls{gps}, magnetometers, and \glspl{imu}.
  The \gls{fpga} is an Artix-7 with 28k logic cells, and the ARM \gls{soc} is
  ARM A9 dual-core @ 667 MHz, including 512 MB \gls{ram} and 128 MB of flash
  memory. It requires an \gls{sd} card of 16 GB for Linux booting and Data
  logging.
  Includes also on-board
  sensors (dual \gls{imu}, barometer), 16 programmable tri-pin \gls{io} and 
  10 programmable \glspl{io} supporting the \gls{i2c}, \gls{usb}, \gls{spi},
  \gls{can}, \gls{csi}, and \gls{gsi} interfaces.
%  
\item \textbf{Companion computer-based platforms}: The Navio2 is a RaspberryPi-based
  autopilot, which supports ArduPilot and PX4 \gls{sw}
  stacks~\cite{arduPilot-Navio2} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:osh-NAVIO2}). Basically, it is an \gls{uav} extension board
  (shield) for the RaspberryPi 2 or later, a quad-core 1 GHz computer running a
  real-time Linux and ArduPilot flight stack. The shield includes on-board
  sensors (dual \gls{imu}, barometer), a \gls{gnss} receiver, an \gls{rc}
  \gls{io} coprocessor, extension ports exposing \gls{adc}, \gls{i2c}, and
  \gls{uart} interfaces for sensors and radios, 14 \gls{pwm} servomotors
  outputs, and a triple redundant power supply.

  The PixC4-Jetson (Fig.~\ref{fig:hw-horizonJetson}) is a high-end \gls{fmu}, powerful single board computer and
  peripheral support system (USB, MIPI, Ethernet, M.2 slot, etc.) in a small
  form factor, designed to be integrated into end-user
  platforms~\cite{arduPilot-horizonJetson}. It supports the ArduPilot and PX4
  \gls{sw} stacks. The term
  ``PixC4'' is derived from the Pixhawk, on which the \gls{fmu} design is based
  (FMUv5) and C4, representing Command, Control, Compute and Communication. It
  is available as a turnkey solution including software pre-flashed on the
  Nvidia Jetson companion~\cite{arduPilot-horizonJetson}, enabling the following
  features: \gls{udp} telemetry (MAVLink); \gls{lte} connection management with
  Layer-2 peer to peer \gls{vpn}; multiple-endpoint video encoding pipelines, web
  interface for configuration and remote terminal access; scalable and secure
  cloud connectivity to Horizon31's U.S. servers and optional access to their
  cloud \gls{gcs} and low-latency web\gls{rtc} video distribution system. It
  feaures the STM32H743 processor with STM IO coprocessor, integrated Nvidia
  Jetson companion computer, ethernet switch (3 port), \gls{usb} 2.0 Hub (7
  port), cellular/\gls{lte} Modem support, and on-board sensors (\gls{imu},
  barometer, and compass). It supports the \gls{pwm}, \gls{i2c}, \gls{uart},
  \gls{spi}, \gls{can}, and \gls{csi}. It is important to note that the
  \gls{fmu} derives from the Pixhawk FMUv5, but can be sold commercially as
  a proprietary solution because it is released under the \gls{bsd} license,
  which does not obligate to make the modifications to the design open to the
  public. Obviously, this is very attractive for companies who want to
  commercialize drones, but do not want to invest the time and money to
  developed an end-to-end solution.

Comparison between the open-source and commercial solutions

Table with multiple dimensions

\subsection{UAV Reference Software}%
\label{sec:uav-ref-sw}
In this section the reference software for \glspl{uav} is discussed. An overview
and the \gls{sw} architecture is presented. Then, the open-source and
commercial solutions are discussed, and compared in the gap-analysis.

\subsubsection{Overview and Architecture}%
\label{sec:overv-arch-sw}
Fig.~\ref{fig:uav-sw-arch} illustrates the high-level abstraction of the
most common structure of \gls{uav} \gls{sw} architecture~\cite{leccadito2018survey,px4-sysArch}. In orange, we have the main computing
platforms --- the flight controller (\gls{fcs}), e.g., Pixhawk, the \gls{gcs}
(e.g., a desktop/laptop computer), and,
optionally, the companion computer, e.g., a RaspberryPi --- in purple the
physical \gls{hw} --- sensors, actuators, and payload --- in green the
layers of the \gls{sw} stack, and the arrows indicate the communication link and
associated protocols.

The \gls{sw} stack structure is the same for the
flight controller and the companion computer:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Application Layer}: this layer is where the applications/tasks
  reside, providing the high-level functionalities of the system. In the flight
  controller we have the critical tasks, namely,
  \emph{Controller}, \emph{Commander}, \emph{Navigator}, \emph{Logger},
  or \emph{Communications}, and in the companion computer the secondary tasks,
  providing mission and navigation extra features, such as, \emph{Collision
    Avoidance}, \emph{Collision Prevention}, \emph{Safe Landing},
  \emph{Odometry}, and \emph{Telemetry}.
%
\item \textbf{Middleware Layer}: the middleware is an intermediate layer,
  responsible for abstracting the interface with the \gls{os} and the
  communications through message passing --- using real-time and or asynchronous
  protocols, such as \gls{rtps}, MAVLink, or \texttt{uORB} --- and for providing
  an extra layer of security enforcing \gls{csp} mechanisms.
%
\item \textbf{\gls{os} Layer}: the \gls{os} provides the basic services for
  system's operation and a straightforward environment for application's
  development. The flight controller hosts a \gls{rtos} to meet the stringent
  requirements and deadlines of the \gls{uav}'s control, such as,
  \texttt{NuttX}, \texttt{FreeRTOS}, \texttt{VxWorks}, and \texttt{ChibiOS}. On
  the other hand, the companion computer hosts a \gls{gpos}, as the applications
  on top have soft real-time requirements. Furthermore, it provides a much
  better bootstrapping environment for ``general'' software development than a
  \gls{rtos}, e.g., \gls{ros}-based avoidance libraries are available for Linux~\cite{px4-sysArch}.
%
\item \textbf{Device Driver Layer (\gls{hal})}: this layer abstracts the
  underlying \gls{hw}, providing a tractable interface for the \gls{os} for data
  acquisition and motors' actuation.
\end{itemize}

The \gls{gcs} \gls{sw} (e.g., \emph{QGroundControl}) typically runs on a desktop/laptop computer or mobile
device providing real-time monitoring of the flight superimposed on a map and
\gls{uav}'s control functionalities via companion computer communication. The
\gls{sw} interface between both systems is achieved through the use of off-board
\glspl{api} or \glspl{sdk}, like \gls{ros} or MAVSDK~\cite{px4-sysArch}.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Open-source solutions}%
\label{sec:open-source-solut-sw}
\glsxtrfull{oss} solutions, like their \gls{hw} counterparts, have been
developed to provide more transparency, extensibility, flexibility,
maintenability, while trying to be cost-effective. \gls{oss} means that the
\gls{sw}'s source code is released under free/libre
terms~\cite{freeGNU}.

The three most prominent \gls{oss} solutions at the moment are \texttt{PX4},
\texttt{ArduPilot}, and \texttt{Paparazzi UAS}.

\paragraph{PX4}
%
PX4 is an autopilot flight stack for drones, started in 2012, released under the
permissible \gls{bsd}-2 license, supporting different \gls{uav}'s airframes and
even others \glspl{uv}. The source code core is on C/C++ and it is available on
Github~\cite{px4-github}. Several commercially available drones have adopted
\texttt{PX4}, and a wider range supports it~\cite{px4-home}.
It supports NuttX and \gls{ros} operating systems~\cite{jargalsaikhan2022architectural}.

PX4 is loaded onto
the flight controller \gls{hw} using the \emph{QGroundControl}
application. \emph{QGroundControl} is also used to configure PX4 and interface
the flight controller. A \gls{rc} unit can be used to manually control the
drone.

PX4 uses the MAVLink protocol to communicate with the flight controller, but
also supports the \gls{rtps} protocol. It uses its message \gls{api} ---
\texttt{uORB} --- for data transfer between its internal modules. It is
automatically started on bootup, and messages are defines as separate
\texttt{.msg} files in the \texttt{msg/} folder~\cite{jargalsaikhan2022architectural}. PX4 uses
several sensors for \gls{uav}'s control or autonomous operation. The minimum set
of sensors are the accelerometers/gyroscopes, magnetometer and barometer, with a
\gls{gps} being required for automatic modes. PX4 produces logs durint flights, which can be analyzed using \emph{Flight
  Review}, or \emph{Px4Tools}~\cite{glossner2021overview}. 

\paragraph{ArduPilot}
%
ArduPilot is an autopilot flight stack for drones, started in 2009,
released under the more restrictable \gls{gpl}v3 license, supporting different \gls{uav}'s airframes and
even others \glspl{uv}. The source code core is on C/C++ and it is available on
Github~\cite{arduPilot-github}.
It supports \emph{Linux} and \emph{ChibiOS} operating systems~\cite{jargalsaikhan2022architectural}.

It is installed on more than a million vehicles and runs on a large number of
\gls{osh} platforms such as \emph{Pixhawk}. \emph{ArduPilot} features include:
multiple flight modes (manual, semi- and full-autonomous) with multiple
stabilization options; progammable missions with 3D waypoints and optional
geofencing; support for multiple sensors and buses; fail-safe actions and
support for navigation in \gls{gps} denied environments~\cite{arduPilot-home}.

\emph{ArduPilot} supports the MAVLink protocol for communication with
\glspl{gcs} and companion computers~\cite{arduPilot-home}. Mission commands are
stored in \gls{eeprom} and executed one-by-one when the vehicle is switched into
\emph{Auto} mode.


\paragraph{Paparazzi UAS}
%
\emph{Paparazzi UAS} is an autopilot flight stack for drones, started in 2003,
released under the \gls{gpl}v2 license, supporting different \gls{uav}'s airframes \glspl{uv}~\cite{paparazzi-home}. The source code core is on C (and a little C++) and it
is available on Github~\cite{paparazzi-github}.
It supports the \emph{ChibiOS} operating system~\cite{jargalsaikhan2022architectural}.

It was designed mainly for autopilot applications, for portability, and
flexibility, with the ability to control multiple aircraft systems within the
same system~\cite{paparazzi-home}.

\emph{Paparazzi UAS} uses its own \emph{PPRZLINK} protocol for communication
with \glspl{gcs} and companion computers~\cite{jargalsaikhan2022architectural}. It uses a proprietary middleware \gls{abi} ---
\emph{AirBorne Ivy} --- to transfer data between modules in a straightforward
way. Messages are defined in a \gls{xml} file with an unique name and \emph{id}.
\emph{Auto} mode.

\paragraph{}
Jargalsaikhan et al.~\cite{jargalsaikhan2022architectural} conducted a survey on the flight control software
portability, more specifically at a module-level basis, analyzing several
academia and \gls{oss} solutions features --- general structure, messaging
mechanisms, and supported \glspl{os} --- and comparing them with the portability
requirements --- simplicity, moduarity, centralized messages, standard
interfaces, \gls{hal}'s implementation, and documentation. It found out that,
from the aforementioned \gls{oss} solutions: only \emph{ArduPilot} and
\emph{PX4} implement a \gls{hal}; \emph{ArduPilot} does not implement a message
centralization mechanism; although open-source, all use proprietary messaging
interfaces, which hinders portability; and that although well documented,
sometimes is hard to understand and/or is partially
outdated. Fig.~\ref{fig:uav-sw-arch-oss-compar} illustrates the \gls{sw} stack
layers and modules for the abovementioned \gls{oss} solutions and the
\emph{mpFCS} --- the portable \gls{fcs} developed by Jargalsaikhan et al.~\cite{jargalsaikhan2022architectural}.

\subsubsection{Commercial solutions}%
\label{sec:commercial-solutions-sw}
Typically, the commercial proprietary solutions do not disclose information
about the product. They provide extensibility through the use of
\glspl{sdk}, like the Dji drones~\cite{djiSDK}, enabling the end-user to use
extra features, but requires specialized knowledge.

On the other hand, and as aforementioned, some commercial solutions can explore
more permissible \gls{oss} licenses, like the \gls{bsd} license provided by PX4,
to add extra functionalities and bundle it as a closed, commercial, product.

If, however, we expand the search to include any proprietary
software component, such as the \texttt{VxWorks} \gls{rtos} then the results'
list becomes significantly larger, namely, the Northrot Grumman X-47B
\gls{uav}~\cite{vxWorks-uav-northrop}, the Airbus
Helionix~\cite{vxWorks-uav-aribus-helionic}, and the Airbus
Atlante~\cite{vxWorks-uav-aribus-atlante}.

On academia, \emph{VxWorks} was also used as \gls{rtos} for \gls{uav}
applications. Chong and Li~\cite{vxworksFCS} designed a \gls{fcs} for small
\glspl{uav} using \emph{VxWorks} as an \gls{rtos} to support tasks partitioning
meeting the real-time requirements. Fig.~\ref{fig:vxworks-sw-arch} illustrates
the software framework designed considering three main layers: functional layer
(application + middleware), \gls{os} layer, and device driver layer. The authors
claimed remarkable improvements in the reliability and real-time capability of
the \gls{fcs} using \texttt{VxWorks}, due to its multitasking capabilities, but did not provide direct comparison with
other \glspl{rtos}.

\glspl{uav}'s market is booming, but the security and safety is often overlooked
in the design~\cite{ferrao2020stuart}. Several vulnerabilities have been
identified~\cite{kishnaCyberVulnerUAVReview2017,nassi2021sok,mohsan2022towards},
with a extensive attack surface area --- \gls{fcs}, \gls{gcs}, chassis, \gls{fpv}
channel, and the cloud services.

The commercial \gls{sw} solutions do not provide the security mechanisms
required, and, furthermore lack transparency. 
%
Buquerin~\cite{buquerin2018security} conducted a security evaluation on the
VxWorks 7 \gls{rtos} --- a commercial professional-level \gls{rtos} --- for
avionic systems. The author reported that basic attacks such as
buffer overflows or string vulnerabilities led to a noticeable performance
decrease in the system. Moreover, no security mechanism protects the system
from malware or command injection vulnerabilities. This poses a major threat on
the system if no supervising technology, like virtualization, is used. On the other hand, good security practices are used in
areas such as cryptography and privilege management.

With the open-source solutions, comes transparency, but, nonetheless, it is
insufficient to meet the mixed-criticality and security requirements.
Zhang et al.~\cite{zhang2021best} compared the two main \glspl{rtos} for drone's applications in the
open-source domain, Nuttx and ChibiOS, with the latter emerging as the best. Not
only ChibiOS outperforms NuttX in most temporal tests, but also, and even more
importantly, succeeds in the priority inversion avoidance test with mutexes
rather than binary semaphores. The context switch overhead is greater for
the NuttX, augmenting the probability of missing deadlines. Furthermore, NuttX
does not provide priority inheritance using mutexes, which may lead to faulty
designs, and has a larger codebase. Since \glspl{uav} have stringent real-time
constraints, ChibiOS appears to the be the best \gls{rtos} for \glspl{fcs}, and
therefore the migration of ArduPilot's from NuttX to ChibiOS is probably a smart
decision.

This leads to some research being conducted on changing the paradigm entirely.
Alladi et al.~\cite{alladi2022UAVBlockain} propose a completely different
approach --- the use of a decentralized architecture to increase security in
\glspl{uav} application through the application of blockchain --- especially in
cooperative environments. Blockchain features such as smart contracts and
consensus mechanisms and the inherent cryptographic foundations, enabling
automation and providing security, according to the authors. Overall, the
blockchain technology helps in overcoming many problems such as coordination,
security, collision avoidance, privacy, decision marking, and signal
jamming. Although it presents great potential, the real-life implementation
seems a little distant.

Virtualization emerges as a viable solution to handle the \gls{uav}'s
mixed-criticality requirements and security, through spatial, temporal, and
fault isolation. Nonetheless, the number of works in these field is still scarce.
Faultrel et al~\cite{fautrel2019hypervisor} proposed an hypervisor based
approach for mixed critical real-time \gls{uav} applications to meet its
stringent timing and criticality requirements and allow \gls{fcs}
certification. The authors used an iterative approach for the construction of
scheduling tables for the \gls{vm}, as they use dynamic partioning. 

However, dynamic partioning increases the latency and undeterminism of the
system, hampering the mixed-criticality requirements. Thus, a static partioning
approach appears to be the best-compromise solution for \glspl{mcs} in
\glspl{uav}' applications.
