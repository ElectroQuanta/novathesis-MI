\begin{ntacknowledgements}

First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof.~Sandro Pinto, for
all the guidance, support, and technical expertise that was so valuable
throughout this process.

To my parents for always pushing me forward and for being the life example of character and sheer determination, a
lamp lit on a stormy day. Thank you also for an upbringing full of debates and
argumentation, which has undoubtedly contributed for mastering the challenges I
took ahead, and for instilling in me the taste in good music which helped me
throughout this journey, listening to the \emph{Music of the Spheres},
and sorry for my constant lack of time.
To my sister, for always being so supportive and caring, helping out with your
immense ingenuity and creativity, a mix between the engineer and the artist.

To my closest friends, Pedro and Chic√£o for taking me out to dinner, which is exactly what one needs sometimes. For all the support and
the true friendship that survives even the end of times. To my beloved dog
Pantufa for adopting me eleven years ago when I was going crazy with my
first MSc thesis and never leaving my side.
