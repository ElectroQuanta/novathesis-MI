	abstract = {Container-based virtualization has gained a significant importance in a deployment of software applications in cloud-based environments. The technology fully relies on operating system features and does not require a virtualization layer (hypervisor) that introduces a performance degradation. Container-based virtualization allows to co-locate multiple isolated containers on a single computation node as well as to decompose an application into multiple containers distributed among several hosts (e.g., in fog computing layer). Such a technology seems very promising in other domains as well, e.g., in industrial automation, automotive, and aviation industry where mixed criticality containerized applications from various vendors can be co-located on shared resources.
However, such industrial domains often require real-time behavior (i.e, a capability to meet predefined deadlines). These capabilities are not fully supported by the container-based virtualization yet. In this work, we provide a systematic literature survey study that summarizes the effort of the research community on bringing real-time properties in container-based virtualization. We categorize existing work into main research areas and identify possible immature points of the technology.},

ISO 26262: Functional Safety – Road Vehicles, has been the de facto standard for functional safety in the automotive electronics domain since the release of its first edition in 2011. It is currently available in its second edition, published in December 2018.
In this paper, we present an overview of the standard, which applies to all activities during the safety lifecycle of system development. In the concept phase of ISO 26262, the hazard and risk assessment process focuses on identifying possible hazards caused by malfunctioning behavior of electrical/electronic (E/E) safety-related systems and mitigating them through the identification of safety goals. The design phase includes system, hardware, and software development, with requirements developed from the safety goals. ISO 26262 also prescribes the functional safety management activities to be performed during the safety lifecycle and provides requirements for the supporting processes.
In addition to presenting an overview of the standard, this paper highlights some major changes introduced in the second edition of ISO 26262.},

	abstract = {Numerous systems have been designed which use virtualization to subdivide the ample resources of a modern computer. Some require specialized hardware, or cannot support commodity operating systems. Some target 100\% binary compatibility at the expense of performance. Others sacrifice security or functionality for speed. Few offer resource isolation or performance guarantees; most provide only best-effort provisioning, risking denial of service.This paper presents Xen, an x86 virtual machine monitor which allows multiple commodity operating systems to share conventional hardware in a safe and resource managed fashion, but without sacrificing either performance or functionality. This is achieved by providing an idealized virtual machine abstraction to which operating systems such as Linux, BSD and Windows XP, can be
              ported
              with minimal effort.Our design is targeted at hosting up to 100 virtual machine instances simultaneously on a modern server. The virtualization approach taken by Xen is extremely efficient: we allow operating systems such as Linux and Windows XP to be hosted simultaneously for a negligible performance overhead --- at most a few percent compared with the unvirtualized case. We considerably outperform competing commercial and freely available solutions in a range of microbenchmarks and system-wide tests.},

ABSTRACT = {Virtualization has been deployed as a key enabling technology for coping with the ever growing complexity and heterogeneity of modern computing systems. However, on its own, classical virtualization is a poor match for modern endpoint embedded system requirements such as safety, security and real-time, which are our main target. Microkernel-based approaches to virtualization have been shown to bridge the gap between traditional and embedded virtualization. This notwithstanding, existent microkernel-based solutions follow a highly para-virtualized approach, which inherently requires a significant software engineering effort to adapt guest operating systems (OSes) to run as userland components. In this paper, we present μ RTZVisor as a new TrustZone-assisted hypervisor that distinguishes itself from state-of-the-art TrustZone solutions by implementing a microkernel-like architecture while following an object-oriented approach. Contrarily to existing microkernel-based solutions, μ RTZVisor is able to run nearly unmodified guest OSes, while, contrarily to existing TrustZone-assisted solutions, it provides a high degree of functionality and configurability, placing strong emphasis on the real-time support. Our hypervisor was deployed and evaluated on a Xilinx Zynq-based platform. Experiments demonstrate that the hypervisor presents a small trusted computing base size (approximately 60KB), and a performance overhead of less than 2\% for a 10 ms guest-switching rate.},

	abstract = {With the emergence of multicore embedded System on Chip (SoC), the integration of several applications with different levels of criticality on the same platform is becoming increasingly popular. These platforms, known as mixed-criticality systems, need to meet numerous requirements such as real-time constraints, Operating System (OS) scheduling, memory and OSes isolation.

To construct mixed-criticality systems, various solutions, based on virtualization extensions, have been presented where OSes are contained in a Virtual Machine (VM) through the use of a hypervisor. However, such implementations usually lack hardware features to ensure a full isolation of other bus masters (e.g., Direct Memory Access (DMA) peripherals, Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)) between OSes. Furthermore on multicore implementation, one core is usually dedicated to one OS, causing CPU underutilization.

To address these issues, this paper presents VOSYSmonitor, a multi-core software layer, which allows the co-execution of a safety-critical Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) and a non-critical General Purpose Operating System (GPOS) on the same hardware ARMv8-A platform.
VOSYSmonitor main differentiation factors with the known solutions is the possibility for a processor to switch between secure and non-secure code execution at runtime. The partitioning is ensured by the ARM TrustZone technology, thus allowing to preserve the usage of virtualization features for the GPOS.

VOSYSmonitor architecture will be detailed in this paper, while benchmarking its performance versus other known solutions.},

	abstract = {With the emergence of multicore embedded System on Chip (SoC), the integration of several applications with different levels of criticality on the same platform is becoming increasingly popular. These platforms, known as mixed-criticality systems, need to meet numerous requirements such as real-time constraints, Operating System (OS) scheduling, memory and OSes isolation.

To construct mixed-criticality systems, various solutions, based on virtualization extensions, have been presented where OSes are contained in a Virtual Machine (VM) through the use of a hypervisor. However, such implementations usually lack hardware features to ensure a full isolation of other bus masters (e.g., Direct Memory Access (DMA) peripherals, Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)) between OSes. Furthermore on multicore implementation, one core is usually dedicated to one OS, causing CPU underutilization.

To address these issues, this paper presents VOSYSmonitor, a multi-core software layer, which allows the co-execution of a safety-critical Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) and a non-critical General Purpose Operating System (GPOS) on the same hardware ARMv8-A platform.
VOSYSmonitor main differentiation factors with the known solutions is the possibility for a processor to switch between secure and non-secure code execution at runtime. The partitioning is ensured by the ARM TrustZone technology, thus allowing to preserve the usage of virtualization features for the GPOS.

VOSYSmonitor architecture will be detailed in this paper, while benchmarking its performance versus other known solutions.},

The regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US had earlier limited the usage of UAVs to military applications. However more recently, the FAA has outlined new enforcement that will also expand the usage of UAVs in civilian and commercial applications. Due to being deployed in open atmosphere, UAVs are vulnerable to being lost, destroyed or physically hijacked. With the UAV technology becoming ubiquitous, various issues in UAV networks such as intra-UAV communication, UAV security, air data security, data storage and management, etc. need to be addressed. Blockchain being a distributed ledger protects the shared data using cryptography techniques such as hash functions and public key encryption. It can also be used for assuring the truthfulness of the information stored and for improving the security and transparency of the UAVs. In this paper, we review various applications of blockchain in UAV networks such as network security, decentralized storage, inventory management, surveillance, etc., and discuss some broader perspectives in this regard. We also discuss various challenges to be addressed in the integration of blockchain and UAVs and suggest some future research directions.}

abstract = {Path planning is one of the most important problems to be explored in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for finding an optimal path between source and destination. Although, in literature, a lot of research proposals exist on the path planning problems of UAVs but still issues of target location and identification persist keeping in view of the high mobility of UAVs. To solve these issues in UAVs path planning, optimal decisions need to be taken for various mission-critical operations performed by UAVs. These decisions require a map or graph of the mission environment so that UAVs are aware of their locations with respect to the map or graph. Keeping focus on the aforementioned points, this paper analyzes various UAVs path planning techniques used over the past many years. The aim of path planning techniques is not only to find an optimal and shortest path but also to provide the collision-free environment to the UAVs. It is important to have path planning techniques to compute a safe path in the shortest possible time to the final destination. In this paper, various path planning techniques for UAVs are classified into three broad categories, i.e., representative techniques, cooperative techniques, and non-cooperative techniques. With these techniques, coverage and connectivity of the UAVs network communication are discussed and analyzed. Based on each category of UAVs path planning, a critical analysis of the existing proposals has also been done. For better understanding, various comparison tables using parameters such as-path length, optimality, completeness, cost-efficiency, time efficiency, energy-efficiency, robustness and collision avoidance are also included in the text. In addition, a number of open research problems based on UAVs path planning and UAVs network communication are explored to provide deep insights to the readers.}

  abstract={The rapid growth of consumer unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is creating promising new business opportunities for cellular operators. On the one hand, UAVs can be connected to cellular networks as new types of user equipment, therefore generating significant revenues for the operators that can guarantee their stringent service requirements. On the other hand, UAVs offer the unprecedented opportunity to realize UAV-mounted flying base stations (BSs) that can dynamically reposition themselves to boost coverage, spectral efficiency, and user quality of experience. Indeed, the standardization bodies are currently exploring possibilities for serving commercial UAVs with cellular networks. Industries are beginning to trial early prototypes of flying BSs or user equipments, while academia is in full swing researching mathematical and algorithmic solutions to address interesting new problems arising from flying nodes in cellular networks. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of all of these developments promoting smooth integration of UAVs into cellular networks. Specifically, we survey: 1) the types of consumer UAVs currently available off-the-shelf; 2) the interference issues and potential solutions addressed by standardization bodies for serving aerial users with the existing terrestrial BSs; 3) the challenges and opportunities for assisting cellular communications with UAV-based flying relays and BSs; 4) the ongoing prototyping and test bed activities; 5) the new regulations being developed to manage the commercial use of UAVs; and 6) the cyber-physical security of UAV-assisted cellular communications.},

ABSTRACT = {UAVs—unmanned aerial vehicles—facilitate data acquisition at temporal and spatial scales that still remain unachievable for traditional remote sensing platforms. However, current legal frameworks that regulate UAVs present significant barriers to research and development. To highlight the importance, impact, and diversity of UAV regulations, this paper provides an exploratory investigation of UAV regulations on the global scale. For this, the methodological approach consists of a research synthesis of UAV regulations, including a thorough literature review and a comparative analysis of national regulatory frameworks. Similarities and contrasting elements in the various national UAV regulations are explored including their statuses from the perspectives of past, present, and future trends. Since the early 2000s, countries have gradually established national legal frameworks. Although all UAV regulations have one common goal—minimizing the risks to other airspace users and to both people and property on the ground—the results reveal distinct variations in all the compared variables. Furthermore, besides the clear presence of legal frameworks, market forces such as industry design standards and reliable information about UAVs as public goods are expected to shape future developments.},

Here we present a taxonomy around which we frame discussion and begin by relating the interesting history of drone development from WWI to the present day. Attention then turns to a number of indicative non-military applications---specifically the opportunities that they offer for precision agriculture (which have clear environmental benefits), their use in the protection of wildlife (particularly endangered species---primarily in Africa), and their role in border security. Subsequently we turn our attention to diverse military applications and question claims that they support so-called `surgical strikes'. We examine ethical issues pertaining to the ways in which they have been employed to date and likely ongoing technological developments. In this latter context we briefly consider the apparent inevitability of the emergence of autonomous armed drones which (when accompanied by other autonomous and semi-autonomous weapons systems) will undoubtedly increase the likelihood, profundity, and pace of conflict. This discussion is augmented by brief consideration of drone swarms and pseudo-satellite technologies.",

The drone industry has been getting significant attention as a model of manufacturing, service and delivery convergence, introducing synergy with the coexistence of different emerging domains. UAVs offer implicit peculiarities such as increased airborne time and payload capabilities, swift mobility, and access to remote and disaster areas. Despite these potential features, including extensive variety of usage, high maneuverability, and cost-efficiency, drones are still limited in terms of battery endurance, flight autonomy and constrained flight time to perform persistent missions. Other critical concerns are battery endurance and the weight of drones, which must be kept low. Intuitively it is not suggested to load them with heavy batteries. This study highlights the importance of drones, goals and functionality problems. In this review, a comprehensive study on UAVs, swarms, types, classification, charging, and standardization is presented. In particular, UAV applications, challenges, and security issues are explored in the light of recent research studies and development.

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to analyze free software for the design, analysis, modelling, and simulation of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Free software is the best choice when the reduction of production costs is necessary; nevertheless, the quality of free software may vary. This paper probably does not include all of the free software, but tries to describe or mention at least the most interesting programs. The first part of this paper summarizes the essential knowledge about UAVs, including the fundamentals of flight mechanics and aerodynamics, and the structure of a UAV system. The second section generally explains the modelling and simulation of a UAV. In the main section, more than 50 free programs for the design, analysis, modelling, and simulation of a UAV are described. Although the selection of the free software has been focused on small subsonic UAVs, the software can also be used for other categories of aircraft in some cases; e.g. for MAVs and large gliders. The applications with an historical importance are also included. Finally, the results of the analysis are evaluated and discussed---a block diagram of the free software is presented, possible connections between the programs are outlined, and future improvements of the free software are suggested.},

The existing flight control software (FCS) of the UAV consists of various types of modules categorized into different layers, and it is responsible for coordinating, monitoring, and controlling the vehicle during its flight. This paper proposes mpFCS, a structure of UAV flight control software, which provides portability to its modules and is easy to expand. The mpFCS consists of four segments and several modules within the segments. mpFCS provides portability for each module within the segment. Existing software does not provide portability for its modules because of the tight coupling resulting from its different and private interfaces. The mpFCS uses interfaces of the standard airborne software architecture to transfer data between its modules. Moreover, the structure provides portability for its modules to run in the standard airborne software environment. In order to verify the mpFCS, we tested the mpFCS with the conformance test suite of the airborne software that provides the testing environment for the interfaces and modules of the software. The mpFCS passed the test. Test results show that all modules of the mpFCS are portable. Additionally, portable modules can be interoperable with other software, and the structure is expandable with new modules that use standard airborne software interfaces.},

ABSTRACT = {This study describes the Computing Platforms (CPs) and the hardware reliability issues of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, which recently attracted significant attention in mission and safety-critical applications demanding a failure-free operation. While the rapid development of the UAV technologies was recently reviewed by survey reports focusing on the architecture, cost, energy efficiency, communication, and civil application aspects, the computing platforms&rsquo; reliability perspective was overlooked. Moreover, due to the rising complexity and diversity of today&rsquo;s UAV CPs, their reliability is becoming a prominent issue demanding up-to-date solutions tailored to the UAV specifics. The objective of this work is to address this gap, focusing on the hardware reliability aspect. This research studies the UAV CPs deployed for representative applications, specific fault and failure modes, and existing approaches for reliability assessment and enhancement in CPs for failure-free UAV operation. This study indicates how faults and failures occur in the various system layers of UAVs and analyzes open challenges. We advocate a concept of a cross-layer reliability model tailored to UAVs&rsquo; onboard intelligence and identify directions for future research in this area.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we present a practical solution to support the adaptable and automated deployment of applications of Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (SUAVs). Our solution is based on virtualization technologies, and considers SUAVs as programmable network platforms capable of executing virtual functions and services, which may be dynamically selected according to the requirements specified by the operator of the aerial vehicles. This way, SUAVs can be flexibly and rapidly adapted to different missions with heterogeneous objectives. The design of our solution is based on Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technologies, developed under the umbrella of the fifth generation of mobile networks (5G), as well as on existing Internet protocol standards, including flying ad hoc network routing protocols. We implemented a functional prototype of our solution using well-known open source technologies, and we demonstrated its practical feasibility with the execution of an IP telephony service. This service was implemented as a set of virtualized network functions, which were automatically deployed and interconnected over an infrastructure of SUAVs, being the telephony service tested with real voice-over-IP terminals.},

	abstract = {The automotive industry has increasingly focused on the integration of systems that perform very specific functions. At the same time, there is an increasing need to reduce Size, Weight, Power and Cost (SWaP-C) and, consequently, the need to group subsystems, usually with different levels of criticality, onto the same hardware platform. Currently, these systems are referred to as Mixed-Criticality System (MCS) and require strong isolation between systems of different criticality to respect the freedom from interference and real-time deadlines. Virtualization emerged as a natural enabler for MCS, since, in addition to providing a way to integrate different subsystems onto the same hardware platform, it enforces a strong isolation among consolidated workloads. Following this trend, hypervisors, developed for server and cloud applications, were retrofitted to embedded system architectures such as Advanced RISC Machine (ARM). These hypervisors do not fulfil the requirements of real-time embedded systems, leading to the rise and adoption of static partitioning hypervisors. BAO is a static partitioning hypervisor, where the necessary resources are assigned to each Virtual Machine (VM) in the design. Hence, this hypervisor is not prepared for sharing peripherals between VMs, without failing to comply with the necessary requirements of MCSs. Under this light, this thesis proposes the development of an infrastructure following a standard commu nication protocol, known as VirtIO, to communicate between two unprivileged VMs, keeping the hypervisor minimalistic and simple. With this infrastructure, there is a VM exclusively assigned and dedicated to shar ing peripherals. Thus, whenever a VMs needs to perform an operation on a shared peripheral, it will have to make a request to the dedicated VM. To solve the limitation of sharing peripherals, it is necessary to relinquish part of the isolation between the dedicated VM and the other VMs. This thesis also proposes the implementation of two VirtIO devices, the virtio-console and the virtio-block, to test the infrastructure and, to share the Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) and Secure Digital (SD) Card peripherals.},

	abstract = {O uso de sistemas embebidos tem crescido exponencialmente em indústrias como a automóvel ou aeronáutica. Isto tem levado a um aumento na complexidade dos sistemas, onde é necessário consolidar várias camadas de software com diferentes níveis de criticidade numa única plataforma de hardware. Para aumentar a segurança destes sistemas, a indústria tem-se focado na tecnologia de virtualização, uma vez que a mesma permite a integração e o isolamento dos vários subsistemas. Recorrendo a um hipervisor é possível partilhar os recursos de hardware entre múltiplas máquinas virtuais (VMs). No entanto, os hipervisores tradicionais não foram desenhados para garantir os requisitos de tempo-real e de segurança. Por este motivo, hipervisores de particionamento estático, como o Jailhouse, que alocam os recursos de hardware estaticamente para as VMs em tempo de design, têm ganho cada vez mais protagonismo. Porém, o Jailhouse depende do Linux para iniciar e gerir as VMs, criando alguns problemas de tempo-real e segurança. Assim sendo, o nosso grupo de investigação focou-se em desenvolver o hipervisor Bao. O Bao implementa uma camada minimalista de software e não tem qualquer dependência de bibliotecas externas. A implementação atual do Bao dá acesso pass-through aos periféricos, não sendo possível a partilha de dispositivos. O trabalho desenvolvido nesta dissertação consiste no desenvolvimento de uma infraestrutura que permite a partilha de dispositivos utilizando VirtIO. Esta infraestrutura deve ser genérica e deve ser com patível com as front-ends já existentes. A infraestrutura do VirtIO é implementada numa máquina virtual dedicada (service guest), cuja função é gerir as múltiplas virtqueues que permitem transmitir e receber dados de outras VMs que utilizam VirtIO. Ao contrário das soluções existentes, nesta dissertação, as back ends do VirtIO são implementadas não no hipervisor, mas numa VM, resultando numa TCB reduzida para o sistema. A segunda parte da dissertação foca-se em implementar duas drivers back-end, i.e., uma para o VirtIO-console e outra para o VirtIO-net. A primeira driver é uma driver simples e é utilizada essencial mente para garantir a validação adequada da interface implementada. A segunda é mais complexa, mas é essencial para qualquer hipervisor moderno.},

	abstract = {Os sistemas embebidos apresentam uma enorme heterogeneidade, incluindo desde pequenos controladores, para sistemas inteligentes operados a bateria até sistemas de computação de alto desempenho em automóveis. Definitivamente, os sistemas embebidos cresceram exponencialmente nos últimos anos, aumentando o seu nível de complexidade numa multiplicidade de indústrias. Tal facto, aportou naturalmente uma consolidação de várias camadas de critícidade sobre a mesma plataforma. Para proporcionar um aumento de isolamento e segurança, a indústria começou a recorrer às capacidades da tecnologia de virtualização. A tecnologia de virtualização permitiu a consolidação e o isolamento de múltiplos subsistemas numa mesma plataforma. Hipervisores, também designados de monitores de máquinas virtuais, são responsáveis pela gestão dos recursos de hardware para as mesmas. No entanto, os hipervisores tradicionais não foram desenhados para garantir requisitos de tempo-real e para as restrições embebidas. Nesse sentido, tanto a indústria com a academia direcionaram esforços para uma nova arquitectura de virtualização, os chamados hipervisores de partição estática. Um exemplo destes hipervisores é o Jailhouse que aloca estáticamente o hardware no momento de inicialização. No entanto, este hipervisor exige que o sistema operativo Linux o inicialize, o que se traduz em desvantagens em termos de tempo de arranque e segurança. Para abordar a maioria dos problemas do Jailhouse, o nosso grupo de investigação desenvolveu o Bao. Bao é um hipervisor estático que não apresenta qualquer dependência externa. Este mesmo hipervisor já implementa a partição da cache de modo a mitigar as interferências causadas pela contenção da partilha da mesma entre máquinas virtuais. Contudo, existem outros pontos de contenção na hierarquia de memória. Assim, a primeira parte desta dissertação concentra-se sobre a implementação de um mecanismo para regulação da largura da banda de memória, cujo o objectivo é o isolamento temporal do controlador DRAM. O mecanismo implementado irá ser avaliado para identificar o nível de capacidade de redução de interferência na DRAM. A segunda fase desta dissertação, explora os possíveis casos de ”side-channel” através do uso de DMAs para avaliar os casos de interferência a nível da plataforma e não apenas ao nível do CPU.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), or drones, have gained a lot of popularity over the last decade. The use of autonomous drones appears to be a viable and low-cost solution to problems in many applications. Path planning capabilities are essential for autonomous control systems. An autonomous drone must be able to rapidly compute feasible and energy-efficient paths to avoid collisions. In this study, we review two key aspects of path planning: environmental representation and path generation techniques. Common path planning techniques are analyzed, and their key limitations are highlighted. Finally, we review thirty-five highly cited publications to identify current trends in drone path planning research. We then use these results to identify factors that need to be addressed in future studies in order to develop a practical path planner for autonomous drones.},

	abstract = {Emerging technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) can provide significant potential in Smart Farming and Precision Agriculture applications, enabling the acquisition of real-time environmental data. IoT devices such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be exploited in a variety of applications related to crops management, by capturing high spatial and temporal resolution images. These technologies are expected to revolutionize agriculture, enabling decision-making in days instead of weeks, promising significant reduction in cost and increase in the yield. Such decisions enable the effective application of farm inputs, supporting the four pillars of precision agriculture, i.e., apply the right practice, at the right place, at the right time and with the right quantity. However, the actual proliferation and exploitation of UAVs in Smart Farming has not been as robust as expected mainly due to the challenges confronted when selecting and deploying the relevant technologies, including the data acquisition and image processing methods. The main problem is that still there is no standardized workflow for the use of UAVs in such applications, as it is a relatively new area. In this article, we review the most recent applications of UAVs for Precision Agriculture. We discuss the most common applications, the types of UAVs exploited and then we focus on the data acquisition methods and technologies, appointing the benefits and drawbacks of each one. We also point out the most popular processing methods of aerial imagery and discuss the outcomes of each method and the potential applications of each one in the farming operations.},

              Background
              Innovative solutions to resupply critical medical logistics and blood products may be required in future near‐peer conflicts. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being used in austere environments and may be a viable platform for medical resupply and the transport of blood products.
            
            
              Methods
              A literature review on PubMed and Google Scholar up to March of 2022 yielded a total of 27 articles that were included in this narrative review. The objectives of this article are to discuss the current limitations of prehospital blood transfusion in military settings, discuss the current uses of UAVs for medical logistics, and highlight the ongoing research surrounding UAVs for blood product delivery.
            
            
              Discussion
              UAVs allow for the timely delivery of medical supplies in numerous settings and have been utilized for both military and civilian purposes. Investigations into the effects of aeromedical transportation on blood products have found minimal blood product degradation when appropriately thermoregulated and delivered in a manner that minimizes trauma. UAV delivery of blood products is now actively being explored by numerous entities around the globe. Current limitations surrounding the lack of high‐quality safety data, engineering constraints over carrying capacity, storage capability, and distance traveled, as well as air space regulations persist.
            
            
              Conclusion
              UAVs may offer a novel solution for the transport of medical supplies and blood products in a safe and timely manner for the forward‐deployed setting. Further research on optimal UAV design, optimal delivery techniques, and blood product safety following transport should be explored prior to implementation.},

	abstract = {The groundbreaking Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) technology has gained significant attention from both academia and industrial experts due to several applications, such as military missions, power lines inspection, precision agriculture, remote sensing, delivery services, traffic monitoring and many more. UAVs are expected to become a mainstream delivery element by 2040 to address the ever-increasing demand for delivery services. Similarly, UAV-assisted monitoring approaches will automate the inspection process, lowering mission costs, increasing access to remote locations and saving time and energy. Despite the fact that unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are gaining popularity in both military and civilian applications, they have a number of limitations and critical problems that must be addressed in order for missions to be effective. One of the most difficult and time-consuming tasks is charging UAVs. UAVs’ mission length and travel distance are constrained by their low battery endurance. There is a need to study multi-UAV charging systems to overcome battery capacity limitations, allowing UAVs to be used for a variety of services while saving time and human resources. Wired and Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) systems have emerged as viable options to successfully solve this difficulty. In the past, several research surveys have focused on crucial aspects of wireless UAV charging. In this review, we have also examined the most emerging charging techniques for UAVs such as laser power transfer (LPT), distributed laser charging (DLC), simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) and simultaneous light wave information and power transfer (SLIPT). The classification and types of UAVs, as well as various battery charging methods, are all discussed in this paper. We’ve also addressed a number of difficulties and solutions for safe operation. In the final section, we have briefly discussed future research directions.},

Based on WCET estimates, engineers make design and implementation decisions to ensure that task executions always complete before their specified deadlines. However, in practice, engineers often cannot provide precise point WCET estimates and prefer to provide plausible WCET ranges. Given a set of real-time tasks with such ranges, we provide an automated technique to determine for what WCET values the system is likely to meet its deadlines and, hence, operate safely with a probabilistic guarantee. Our approach combines a search algorithm for generating worst-case scheduling scenarios with polynomial logistic regression for inferring probabilistic safe WCET ranges. We evaluated our approach by applying it to three industrial systems from different domains and several synthetic systems. Our approach efficiently and accurately estimates probabilistic safe WCET ranges within which deadlines are likely to be satisfied with a high degree of confidence.},

Our solution is based on virtualization technologies, and considers SUAVs as programmable network platforms capable of executing virtual functions and services, which may be dynamically selected according to the requirements specified by the operator of the aerial vehicles. This way, SUAVs can be flexibly and rapidly adapted to different missions with heterogeneous objectives. The design of our solution is based on Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technologies, developed under the umbrella of the fifth generation of mobile networks (5G), as well as on existing Internet protocol standards, including flying ad hoc network routing protocols. We implemented a functional prototype of our solution using well-known open source technologies, and we demonstrated its practical feasibility with the execution of an IP telephony service. This service was implemented as a set of virtualized network functions, which were automatically deployed and interconnected over an infrastructure of SUAVs, being the telephony service tested with real voice-over-IP terminals.},

	abstract = {Virtualization plays an essential role in providing security to computational systems by isolating execution environments. Many software solutions, called hypervisors, have been proposed to provide virtualization capabilities. However, only a few were designed for being deployed at the edge of the network in devices with fewer computation resources when compared with servers in the Cloud. Among the few lightweight software that can play the hypervisor role, seL4 stands out by providing a small Trusted Computing Base and formally verified components, enhancing its security. Despite today being more than a decade with seL4 microkernel technology, its existing userland and tools are still scarce and not very mature. Over the last few years, the main effort has been to increase the maturity of the kernel itself, and not the tools and applications that can be hosted on top. Therefore, it currently lacks proper support for a full-featured userland Virtual Machine Monitor, and the existing one is quite fragmented. This article discusses the potential directions to a standard VMM by presenting our view of design principles and the feature set needed. This article does not intend to define a standard VMM, we intend to instigate this discussion through the seL4 community.},

	abstract = {Multi- and many-core processors are becoming increasingly popular in embedded systems. Many of these processors now feature hardware virtualization capabilities, such as the ARM Cortex A15, and x86 processors with Intel VT-x or AMD-V support. Hardware virtualization offers opportunities to partition physical resources, including processor cores, memory and I/O devices amongst guest virtual machines. Mixed criticality systems and services can then co-exist on the same platform in separate virtual machines. However, traditional virtual machine systems are too expensive because of the costs of trapping into hypervisors to multiplex and manage machine physical resources on behalf of separate guests. For example, hypervisors are needed to schedule separate VMs on physical processor cores. In this paper, we discuss the design of the Quest-V separation kernel, that partitions services of different criticalities in separate virtual machines, or sandboxes. Each sandbox encapsulates a subset of machine physical resources that it manages without requiring intervention of a hypervisor. Moreover, a hypervisor is not needed for normal operation, except to bootstrap the system and establish communication channels between sandboxes.},

            The heavy use of machine learning algorithms in safety-critical systems poses serious questions related to safety, security, and predictability issues, requiring novel architectural approaches to guarantee such properties. This paper presents an architecture solution that leverages heterogeneous platforms and virtualization technologies to support AI-powered applications consisting of modules with mixed criticalities and safety requirements. The hypervisor exploits the security features of the Xilinx ZCU104 MPSoCs to create two isolated execution environments: a high performance domain running deep learning algorithms under the Linux operating system and a safety-critical domain running control and monitoring functions under the freeRTOS real-time operating system. The proposed approach is validated by a use case consisting of an unmanned aerial vehicle capable of tracking moving targets using a deep neural network accelerated on the FGPA available on the platform.},
