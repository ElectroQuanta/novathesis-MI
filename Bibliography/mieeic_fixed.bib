ABSTRACT = {Virtualization has been deployed as a key enabling technology for coping with the ever growing complexity and heterogeneity of modern computing systems. However, on its own, classical virtualization is a poor match for modern endpoint embedded system requirements such as safety, security and real-time, which are our main target. Microkernel-based approaches to virtualization have been shown to bridge the gap between traditional and embedded virtualization. This notwithstanding, existent microkernel-based solutions follow a highly para-virtualized approach, which inherently requires a significant software engineering effort to adapt guest operating systems (OSes) to run as userland components. In this paper, we present μ RTZVisor as a new TrustZone-assisted hypervisor that distinguishes itself from state-of-the-art TrustZone solutions by implementing a microkernel-like architecture while following an object-oriented approach. Contrarily to existing microkernel-based solutions, μ RTZVisor is able to run nearly unmodified guest OSes, while, contrarily to existing TrustZone-assisted solutions, it provides a high degree of functionality and configurability, placing strong emphasis on the real-time support. Our hypervisor was deployed and evaluated on a Xilinx Zynq-based platform. Experiments demonstrate that the hypervisor presents a small trusted computing base size (approximately 60KB), and a performance overhead of less than 2\% for a 10 ms guest-switching rate.},

  pages={231-238},
  abstract={With the emergence of multicore embedded System on Chip (SoC), the integration of several applications with different levels of criticality on the same platform is becoming increasingly popular. These platforms, known as mixed-criticality systems, need to meet numerous requirements (e.g. real-time constraints, multiple Operating Systems (OS) scheduling, providing temporal and spatial isolation). In this context Virtual Open Systems has developed VOSYSmonitor, a thin software layer, which allows the co-execution of a safety-critical and noncritical applications on a single ARM-based multi-core SoC. This software element has been developed according to the ISO 26262 standard. One of the key aspects of this standard is the control of random and systematic failures, including the ones induced by faulty or aging hardware. In the case of a software component, the means to detect anomalies on the hardware are limited and depend on choices of the manufacturer (i.e. implementation of Dual redundant Core Lock step (DCLS)). However, the software is able to check a part of these failures. It can be by either reading the configuration registers of a peripheral, or checking the sanity of a memory region. The purpose of this paper is to showcase how a safety-related software element (e.g. VOSYSmonitor) can detect and recover from failures, while ensuring that the safety-related goals are still reached.},

The regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US had earlier limited the usage of UAVs to military applications. However more recently, the FAA has outlined new enforcement that will also expand the usage of UAVs in civilian and commercial applications. Due to being deployed in open atmosphere, UAVs are vulnerable to being lost, destroyed or physically hijacked. With the UAV technology becoming ubiquitous, various issues in UAV networks such as intra-UAV communication, UAV security, air data security, data storage and management, etc. need to be addressed. Blockchain being a distributed ledger protects the shared data using cryptography techniques such as hash functions and public key encryption. It can also be used for assuring the truthfulness of the information stored and for improving the security and transparency of the UAVs. In this paper, we review various applications of blockchain in UAV networks such as network security, decentralized storage, inventory management, surveillance, etc., and discuss some broader perspectives in this regard. We also discuss various challenges to be addressed in the integration of blockchain and UAVs and suggest some future research directions.}

abstract = {Path planning is one of the most important problems to be explored in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for finding an optimal path between source and destination. Although, in literature, a lot of research proposals exist on the path planning problems of UAVs but still issues of target location and identification persist keeping in view of the high mobility of UAVs. To solve these issues in UAVs path planning, optimal decisions need to be taken for various mission-critical operations performed by UAVs. These decisions require a map or graph of the mission environment so that UAVs are aware of their locations with respect to the map or graph. Keeping focus on the aforementioned points, this paper analyzes various UAVs path planning techniques used over the past many years. The aim of path planning techniques is not only to find an optimal and shortest path but also to provide the collision-free environment to the UAVs. It is important to have path planning techniques to compute a safe path in the shortest possible time to the final destination. In this paper, various path planning techniques for UAVs are classified into three broad categories, i.e., representative techniques, cooperative techniques, and non-cooperative techniques. With these techniques, coverage and connectivity of the UAVs network communication are discussed and analyzed. Based on each category of UAVs path planning, a critical analysis of the existing proposals has also been done. For better understanding, various comparison tables using parameters such as-path length, optimality, completeness, cost-efficiency, time efficiency, energy-efficiency, robustness and collision avoidance are also included in the text. In addition, a number of open research problems based on UAVs path planning and UAVs network communication are explored to provide deep insights to the readers.}

  abstract={The rapid growth of consumer unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is creating promising new business opportunities for cellular operators. On the one hand, UAVs can be connected to cellular networks as new types of user equipment, therefore generating significant revenues for the operators that can guarantee their stringent service requirements. On the other hand, UAVs offer the unprecedented opportunity to realize UAV-mounted flying base stations (BSs) that can dynamically reposition themselves to boost coverage, spectral efficiency, and user quality of experience. Indeed, the standardization bodies are currently exploring possibilities for serving commercial UAVs with cellular networks. Industries are beginning to trial early prototypes of flying BSs or user equipments, while academia is in full swing researching mathematical and algorithmic solutions to address interesting new problems arising from flying nodes in cellular networks. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of all of these developments promoting smooth integration of UAVs into cellular networks. Specifically, we survey: 1) the types of consumer UAVs currently available off-the-shelf; 2) the interference issues and potential solutions addressed by standardization bodies for serving aerial users with the existing terrestrial BSs; 3) the challenges and opportunities for assisting cellular communications with UAV-based flying relays and BSs; 4) the ongoing prototyping and test bed activities; 5) the new regulations being developed to manage the commercial use of UAVs; and 6) the cyber-physical security of UAV-assisted cellular communications.},

ABSTRACT = {UAVs—unmanned aerial vehicles—facilitate data acquisition at temporal and spatial scales that still remain unachievable for traditional remote sensing platforms. However, current legal frameworks that regulate UAVs present significant barriers to research and development. To highlight the importance, impact, and diversity of UAV regulations, this paper provides an exploratory investigation of UAV regulations on the global scale. For this, the methodological approach consists of a research synthesis of UAV regulations, including a thorough literature review and a comparative analysis of national regulatory frameworks. Similarities and contrasting elements in the various national UAV regulations are explored including their statuses from the perspectives of past, present, and future trends. Since the early 2000s, countries have gradually established national legal frameworks. Although all UAV regulations have one common goal—minimizing the risks to other airspace users and to both people and property on the ground—the results reveal distinct variations in all the compared variables. Furthermore, besides the clear presence of legal frameworks, market forces such as industry design standards and reliable information about UAVs as public goods are expected to shape future developments.},

Here we present a taxonomy around which we frame discussion and begin by relating the interesting history of drone development from WWI to the present day. Attention then turns to a number of indicative non-military applications---specifically the opportunities that they offer for precision agriculture (which have clear environmental benefits), their use in the protection of wildlife (particularly endangered species---primarily in Africa), and their role in border security. Subsequently we turn our attention to diverse military applications and question claims that they support so-called `surgical strikes'. We examine ethical issues pertaining to the ways in which they have been employed to date and likely ongoing technological developments. In this latter context we briefly consider the apparent inevitability of the emergence of autonomous armed drones which (when accompanied by other autonomous and semi-autonomous weapons systems) will undoubtedly increase the likelihood, profundity, and pace of conflict. This discussion is augmented by brief consideration of drone swarms and pseudo-satellite technologies.",

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to analyze free software for the design, analysis, modelling, and simulation of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Free software is the best choice when the reduction of production costs is necessary; nevertheless, the quality of free software may vary. This paper probably does not include all of the free software, but tries to describe or mention at least the most interesting programs. The first part of this paper summarizes the essential knowledge about UAVs, including the fundamentals of flight mechanics and aerodynamics, and the structure of a UAV system. The second section generally explains the modelling and simulation of a UAV. In the main section, more than 50 free programs for the design, analysis, modelling, and simulation of a UAV are described. Although the selection of the free software has been focused on small subsonic UAVs, the software can also be used for other categories of aircraft in some cases; e.g. for MAVs and large gliders. The applications with an historical importance are also included. Finally, the results of the analysis are evaluated and discussed---a block diagram of the free software is presented, possible connections between the programs are outlined, and future improvements of the free software are suggested.},

ABSTRACT = {This study describes the Computing Platforms (CPs) and the hardware reliability issues of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, which recently attracted significant attention in mission and safety-critical applications demanding a failure-free operation. While the rapid development of the UAV technologies was recently reviewed by survey reports focusing on the architecture, cost, energy efficiency, communication, and civil application aspects, the computing platforms&rsquo; reliability perspective was overlooked. Moreover, due to the rising complexity and diversity of today&rsquo;s UAV CPs, their reliability is becoming a prominent issue demanding up-to-date solutions tailored to the UAV specifics. The objective of this work is to address this gap, focusing on the hardware reliability aspect. This research studies the UAV CPs deployed for representative applications, specific fault and failure modes, and existing approaches for reliability assessment and enhancement in CPs for failure-free UAV operation. This study indicates how faults and failures occur in the various system layers of UAVs and analyzes open challenges. We advocate a concept of a cross-layer reliability model tailored to UAVs&rsquo; onboard intelligence and identify directions for future research in this area.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we present a practical solution to support the adaptable and automated deployment of applications of Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (SUAVs). Our solution is based on virtualization technologies, and considers SUAVs as programmable network platforms capable of executing virtual functions and services, which may be dynamically selected according to the requirements specified by the operator of the aerial vehicles. This way, SUAVs can be flexibly and rapidly adapted to different missions with heterogeneous objectives. The design of our solution is based on Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technologies, developed under the umbrella of the fifth generation of mobile networks (5G), as well as on existing Internet protocol standards, including flying ad hoc network routing protocols. We implemented a functional prototype of our solution using well-known open source technologies, and we demonstrated its practical feasibility with the execution of an IP telephony service. This service was implemented as a set of virtualized network functions, which were automatically deployed and interconnected over an infrastructure of SUAVs, being the telephony service tested with real voice-over-IP terminals.},
